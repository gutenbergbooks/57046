    <div>THE DUSKY ROBBER</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Elizabeth Houghton sat on a big
stone beside the road, just where the highway
forked, her school books still tucked under
her arm. Her round blue eyes stared straight
before her, as she tried, with one last effort, to
make up her mind. For a whole week she had been
attempting to reach a decision: that very morning
she had told herself sternly that the matter must be
settled to-day, yet still she had kept on debating inwardly,
hour after hour, saying, one moment, “I
will,” and the next, “I won’t.” In the late afternoon
she had set out for Aunt Susan’s to announce
her decision, but here she was pausing at the turn
of the way, still irresolute.</p>

<p class='c007'>If she went onward by the broad highroad that
stretched before her, she would come to the big
country-house where her aunt lived and where,
once inside the door, all her doubts and hesitations
would be swept away by Aunt Susan’s forcible arguments.
On the other hand, if she climbed the hill
up the narrower branch of the way, Somerset Lane,
she would come, she knew, to the white cottage beside
the road where lived Miss Miranda Reynolds,
a friend of her father’s whom she had been bidden
to go to see. When she set forth after school she
had purposed vaguely going to one place or the
other. If to Miss Reynolds’, it would be putting
off the moment of her decision a little longer, if to
Aunt Susan’s, it would end in settling the matter
once for all.</p>

<p class='c007'>She turned about on the stone and looked up the
crooked path of Somerset Lane, winding steeply up
the slope above her and ending before a great stone
entrance-way with barred iron gates. Beyond the
gates she could catch further glimpses of rising
ground, groups of trees and, at the very summit of
the hill, the broken walls of a ruined building. It
must have been a fire, she concluded, after staring
upward for some minutes, that had so blackened the
stone walls and left them standing, empty and desolate,
with here and there a blank window or the part
of an arched doorway. For very weariness with
pondering her own problem, she began to let her
mind wander away in vague curiosity as to how
such destruction had come about and how the fire
had looked as it had swept blazing across the long
roofs until they crashed and fell, had glowed behind
the empty windows and had gone up in columns of
sparks and flame above the dark trees. Her father
had told her nothing of this big ruined house at the
top of the hill, he had merely directed her to look for
the Reynolds cottage half way up the slope among
the maple trees. No doubt, Elizabeth thought, Miss
Reynolds could give her an account of the fire. This
idea gave some point to a visit in which she had felt
very little interest until now. She had a twinge of
conscience as she sat looking up the lane remembering
how long it was since she had promised her
father to go, and how she should have climbed that
steep way many days before.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elizabeth had not lived very long in this neighborhood,
for this was early spring and it had been
only at Christmas time that she and her father and
Irish Anna, who kept house for them, had come to
Harwood to settle down in what had been Mr.
Houghton’s old home. Even here, after many
other moves, the question of uprooting soon came up
again, for in March her father had been summoned
to England to spend six months.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish it were not going to be so lonely for you,
Betsey,” he had said as he made preparations to
go, “but at least you will be busy. I am glad that
we have found such a good school for you at last.
A few more changes, and your education would have
been wrecked entirely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey had always meant to go to college and was
now in the last half-year of her preparation. Transfers
from one school to another had indeed resulted
in so much lost time that she was already a little behind
her proper class and would, so she agreed with
her father, lose all chances of fulfilling her plans
should she change again. She sighed deeply as she
thought of it, sitting there upon the stone, for it was
this very question that was casting shadows over a
very brilliant prospect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very soon after Mr. Houghton’s departure, Betsey’s
Aunt Susan, growing weary of the life of her
quiet country place, big and luxurious though it
was, had pressed upon her niece a dazzling invitation.
It was to accompany her on a journey that
would include Bermuda, Panama, California, and,
when hot weather came, the Canadian Rockies. It
became difficult for Elizabeth even to think of more
months of plodding study, when, sitting at her desk,
she could picture the flowers and palms of Bermuda,
its coral caves with floors of rippling water, or the
lazy breakers tumbling in on some California beach.
But to go would mean giving up college, that was
certain. And Elizabeth’s mother, who had died five
years before, had always wanted her to go to college!</p>

<p class='c007'>So long did she sit there on the stone under the
big oak tree, hesitating and debating, that presently
there was a rumble of thunder, followed by the sharp
spatter of rain on the little new leaves above her
head. The low-hanging branches sheltered her like
a roof so that she had only to sit there with her
hands clasped about her knee, waiting for the shower
to pass and for her puzzled thoughts to set themselves
in order. She was wishing greatly for her
father’s advice, but that it would be impossible to
get in time. Anna, good-natured and interested as
she was, could offer little more than, “Sure it would
be grand to go to college and learn so much,” or, if
the talk happened to turn in another direction, “Sure
it would be grand to go to California and see all the
pretty flowers,” so that her opinions were of no very
great help.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elizabeth could see below her, as she sat there,
rolling stretches of field and meadow and patches of
woodland turning from brown to fresh spring green.
Almost too far away to be visible on this day of fitful
lights and shadows, were the crowded roofs and
spires of a distant town and, to the east of them,
the high, gray towers of that very college about
which her dreams and ambitions had clustered so
long.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it will be so lonely here!” she cried almost
aloud, all her thoughts rising to sudden protest. She
had friends of her own age at school, plenty of them,
but what older person was there to whom she could
go in doubt or difficulty, who was there to give her
help or advice when she should need it? She felt
lost and helpless at the thought and utterly forlorn.
No, she could not bear it, she would go with
Aunt Susan, her choice would be for change and
travel and the seeing of beautiful things instead of
the long empty road of hard work that stretched before
her. Her battered geometry and Latin books
slipped from her knee and lay, face downward and
unheeded, on the grass. She had made up her mind—almost.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shower had cleared and the clouds were
sweeping away in rolling thunderheads of gray and
shining silver. The moving sunlight touched the
roofs of the town and lit, at last, the slim towers of
the college so that they showed white and glittering
against the dark background of the trees. Usually
they seemed dim and distant, Elizabeth had thought,
and never, as to-day, so near, so clear, possessed of
such dignity of grace and beauty. She could not
quite tell what it was, curiosity, doubt, hesitation,
or all three at once that made her, when she got up
to go, turn into Somerset Lane instead of along the
highway, and that caused her to put off again the
moment of letting Aunt Susan convince her that she
should go to Bermuda.</p>

<p class='c007'>She began to feel, as she climbed the hill, a good
deal of curiosity concerning this Miss Miranda of
whom her father had said so much and whom she
should have gone to see long ago. Would she be
all stiff manners and critical eyes, she wondered, the
kind of person to make you feel awkward and tongue-tied
the moment you crossed the threshold? It was
the feeling that she must be something of the sort
that had kept Betsey from coming for all this time.
For some distance the lane wound and twisted so
that she could not catch any glimpse of the white cottage
that she sought. Once she stopped where a
side path, a mere rough track bordered by Lombardy
poplars, led away to the left. Could that be
the way, she wondered, but no, it must lead only to
the fields beyond, for here was a heavy white farm
horse, evidently just come from plowing, turning
into the path through a gap in the hedge. The big
creature lifted his feet slowly, seeming comfortably
tired after a well-spent day among the furrows, as
he trudged leisurely along under the slender shadows
of the wet poplar trees. He bore an equally weary
rider, a boy of about Elizabeth’s own age, who was
perched sideways on the broad back, his legs swinging
with every lurch of the horse’s shoulders, his hat
held on his knee so that Elizabeth could see plainly
his hot, sunburned face and his rumpled, red-brown
hair. He did not observe her, for he was looking
away across the valley toward that same group of
towers that she herself had been watching, as though
the distant college held a fascination for him as well
as for her. She thought for a moment of waiting
to ask him the way, but her eye caught sight, just
then, of a green roof above her among the trees and
she went onward.</p>

<p class='c007'>As she opened the gate beside the lane and
walked up the path to the house, she felt, almost in
spite of herself, an immediate liking for the place.
It was a tiny white cottage with a wide-eaved roof,
with two big red brick chimneys that told of broad
hearthstones inside, with swinging windows and
clambering vines and a square lawn skirted at one
side by a high stone wall. Beyond this wall she
could see again the blackened ruins that had aroused
her curiosity as she sat at the crossroads below.
What a wide and stately house it must have been
there at the top of the hill and how strange it was
that it had never been rebuilt! She must be sure
to ask Miss Reynolds about it, for there was, somehow,
a spell of haunting mystery about those roofless
walls and empty windows that seemed to stare away
across the wide view spread out below them. There
was time for her to observe all these things as she
stood upon the doorstep for, although she rang the
bell twice, no one came to admit her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t want to come all this way for nothing,”
she thought; “I will go to the side door and find
some way of leaving word that I have been here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Following the pathway of flagstones, she turned
the corner of the house and found that a wing of
the cottage extended at right angles before her and
that in it was a door, standing open. She stopped
a moment to examine some crocuses that were pushing
up through the new grass, but she was interrupted
and startled by the sound of some one speaking,
apparently to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good morning,” a voice was saying, a harsh
rough voice with a rasp and a squeak in it such as she
had never before heard. “Good morning, good
morning!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She looked about, but could see no one. Evidently
the sound came from within the open door,
so she ran to it quickly and peeped inside.</p>

<p class='c007'>A white-haired man sat at a table with his back to
her, so intent upon what he was doing that it could
not have been he who had spoken. She had expected
to see a kitchen, but found instead that the
place was some sort of a workshop with strange
intricate pieces of machinery standing, some of them
under glass cases, on benches and shelves along the
walls. The man must be Miss Miranda’s father,
she concluded. She had heard her own father
speak of him as quite a famous person, a scientist of
long standing reputation. Yet it seemed a tiny,
shabby place in which to find a great man! As she
stood, wondering, upon the step, there came a hoarse
chuckling from the shadows in the corner of the
room and out came strutting and fluttering a big,
black crow. He was not trying to talk now, but
was cawing softly and clucking to himself as he advanced
sideways, half spreading his wings and cocking
his eye, first at the old gentleman, then at Betsey
standing in the doorway. He had evidently some
plot brewing in his wicked black head, for he fluttered
to the edge of the table, sidled nearer and
nearer and finally, with a sudden dart, pounced upon
a pair of spectacles that lay on the blotter and flew
out of the door over Elizabeth’s head.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old gentleman looked up, startled and blinking.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miranda, oh Miranda,” he called helplessly.
“That wretched Dick has stolen my spectacles
again!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miranda came running in from what must
have been the kitchen, for she wore a blue apron
and had a measuring cup still in her hand. Elizabeth
saw at a glance that she was very pretty, with
brown hair that curled and crinkled in spite of a
streak or two of gray, and with cheeks that were pink
from the heat of the fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I believe, my dear,” her father added
vaguely, as she came in, “that there is some one at
the door.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was astonishing to see what a strange effect this
simple statement had, for Miss Miranda’s face
turned suddenly white and she looked toward the
door with startled, frightened eyes. Her smile,
when she saw who it was, seemed as bright with relief
as it was with welcome.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think your crow has carried the spectacles up
into that apple tree,” announced Elizabeth, who had
been watching the black thief and now saw him rocking
on a high bough, cawing his triumph. “I can
climb up and get them for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She dropped her school books on the step and ran
across the grass quite forgetting to explain who she
was or why she had come.</p>

<p class='c007'>The branches of the tree were so low that the
climb was no difficult one for a person as agile as
Betsey. The wicked Dick fluttered about her head,
rasping out his harsh protests, as she clambered
higher and higher, but he had wedged his prize so
firmly in a crotch that he could not get it out and was
forced to see her carry it away. He was too well-trained
a pet to attempt to peck her, but he sat on
the wall and voiced his loud displeasure long after
she had disappeared into the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old gentleman put on the spectacles and returned
to his work very placidly, as though such
robberies were too frequent for comment. Miss
Miranda led Elizabeth away toward her own little
sitting room above her father’s workshop.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Won’t you tell me about that house,” Betsey began
promptly, afraid that she might miss obtaining
the information that she desired, “that place there
beyond the wall that looks as if a fire—”</p>

<p class='c007'>The glass cup that Miss Miranda still carried
dropped clattering to the floor and shivered into a
dozen pieces with a startling crash.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How very awkward of me,” she exclaimed
apologetically as she stooped to gather up the fragments.
Betsey, however, as she helped to collect
the broken glass, had a vague realization that the
awkwardness may have lain in her own blunt question
and followed her new friend upstairs with no
effort to follow her inquiries farther.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is another shower coming up,” Miss Miranda
said, “so we will light the fire here and be
very cozy until it passes. I have just baked some
gingerbread and some one really must try it while
it is still fresh.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was certainly delightful to sit in a cushioned
chair by the wide fireplace where a few sticks were
burning, to drink cool milk and eat new gingerbread
and to hear the rain drumming on the tiles outside
the casement window. Miss Miranda, sitting opposite
with her knitting, was asking questions about
Elizabeth’s father, about her work and her school
and her plans for college, in which she seemed to be
much interested. But she did not force the talk and
left her guest leisure to lean back in her chair, sip
her milk and watch, through the rain-spattered glass,
a wet robin taking refuge from the rain below the
dormer window ledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” Betsey assented, in answer to one of the
last questions, “I like the school work well enough,
but sometimes it seems very long and hard and I cannot
help thinking about—other things. I begin to
believe these last months of the term will never end.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miranda had risen to fetch another ball of
yarn and was standing now by the big mahogany
secretary beyond the fireplace. Elizabeth was just
beginning to notice what a wonderful old piece of
furniture it was, so large that it occupied almost all
of one side of the room. It had brass-handled
drawers below and, above, glass doors that opened
upon a perfect labyrinth of shelves, recesses and
deep pigeonholes. She caught sight of something
glittering on the topmost shelf.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, please, could I see what that is?” she
begged. “The little tree—and oh, that silver
figure just below. I never saw anything quite like
them before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Most willingly Miss Miranda threw both the
doors wide open.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is the family toy-cupboard,” she said.
“The desk itself belonged to my great-grandfather,
who was an officer in the Navy, and who used it to
hold such treasures as he brought home from beyond
the seas. Since his time every one of us who
has something precious that he wants to keep or
that has a story connected with it, puts it on these
shelves. Many things have found their way here
that I love dearly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She set upon the table a row of strangely fashioned
objects, a gold lacquer box with a trail of white
wistaria across its lid, a big silver bowl with Moorish
carvings, a long steel dagger with a thin blade
and a twisted handle—a bewildering number of
odd and beautiful treasures. It was over the last
one that Betsey exclaimed aloud in delight. It was
a little pine tree in a pot, twisted and gnarled and
crooked, such as grows in Japanese or Chinese
gardens, the whole not more than six inches high.
At first she thought it was real and growing, but, on
looking closer, saw that it was made of carved jade
and enamel, set in a pot of gleaming yellow and
white porcelain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, where was it ever found?” she asked.
“Who could have made anything so little and so
lovely?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miranda nodded, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is my favorite too,” she said. “Would
you think that human fingers, and they were old, stiff
ones at that, could have carved anything so tiny as
those perfect little needles and the brown cones? It
was one of my great-grandfather’s treasures; there
are many things of his here, all of them a hundred
years old. But here are some that are newer and
this, the newest of all, is a silver medal my brother
sent me from France, from the Jeanne d’Arc church
in Domremy. He went overseas at the beginning of
the war and, even now that it is over, still finds work
to keep him, so that we do not know when he will
come home. This silver figure that you asked about
belongs to him, it is an image of Saint Christopher.
An Irishman, Michael Martin, whom my brother
Ted first knew when he visited some cousins in Montana
and whom he afterward persuaded my father to
bring here to work for us, gave him the little statue.
Michael said that Ted was bound to be a wanderer
and that Saint Christopher is especially good to travelers,
that he keeps them from dangers by fire, storm,
earthquake and such perilous things. But Ted, to
Michael’s great grief, never pays much attention to
charms, and left Saint Christopher behind when he
went to France, so I put it here for safe keeping in
the toy cupboard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elizabeth was turning the little, shining figure over
and over in her hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must have been Michael’s most precious treasure,”
Miss Miranda went on. “He loved my
brother so dearly that he wanted to give him the best
he had. He is very old now and lives in a little
house down the lane. He helps me with the garden
still and is the most faithful and devoted friend that
ever a family knew. I believe I must tell you how
Ted first came to know him and of the adventure
they had together that resulted in the coming of
Michael and Saint Christopher into our household.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elizabeth drew a deep sigh of satisfaction and settled
down more comfortably among the cushions.
Miss Miranda stirred the fire a little and took up
her knitting.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It all happened a great many years ago,” she
said, “but like all real stories it has not ended yet,
nor will it until, as Michael claims, the spell of Saint
Christopher brings my brother safe home again.”</p>

    <div>THE WHITE DOGS OF ARRAN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>For a long hour, on that November afternoon,
my brother Ted had been standing at
the gate below the ranch house, waiting and
waiting, while the twilight filled the round hollow of
the valley as water slowly fills a cup. At last the
figure of a rider, silhouetted against the rose-colored
sky, came into view along the crest of the rocky
ridge. The little cow pony was loping as swiftly
as the rough trail would permit, but to Ted’s impatient
eyes it seemed to crawl as slowly as a fly on a
window pane. Although the horseman looked like
a cow puncher, at that distance, with his slouch hat
and big saddle, the eager boy knew that it was the
district doctor making his far rounds over the range.
A swift epidemic had been sweeping over Montana,
passing from one ranch to another and leaving much
illness and suffering behind. Ted’s uncle and the
cousin who was his own age had both been stricken
two days before and it seemed that the doctor would
never come.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m glad you are here,” he said as the doctor’s
pony, covered with foam and quivering with fatigue,
passed through the open gate. “We have two patients
for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man nodded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fever, I suppose,” he commented, “and aching
bones, and don’t know what to make of themselves
because they have never been sick before? I have
seen a hundred such cases in the last few days. It is
bad at all the ranches, but the sheep herders, off in
their cabins by themselves, are hit particularly hard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He slipped from the saddle and strode into the
house, leaving Ted to take the tired pony around
to the stables. It was very dark now and growing
cold, but he felt warmed and comforted, somehow,
since the doctor had come. He heard running feet
behind him and felt a dog’s nose, cold and wet,
thrust into his hand. It was Pedro, the giant, six
months’ old wolf hound puppy, long legged and
shaggy haired, the pride of Ted’s life and the best
beloved of all his possessions. The big dog followed
his master into the stable and sat down, blinking
solemnly in the circle of lantern light, while the
boy was caring for the doctor’s horse and bedding
it down.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ted’s thoughts were very busy, now with his anxieties
about his uncle, now racing out over the range
to wonder how those in the stricken ranch houses
and lonely cabins might be faring. There was the
ranch on Arran Creek—people there were numerous
enough to care for each other. It might be
worse at Thompson’s Crossing, and, oh how would
it be with those shepherds who lived in tiny cottages
here and there along the Big Basin, so far from
neighbors that often for months they saw no other
faces than the woolly vacant ones of their thousands
of sheep.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was one, a big, grizzled Irishman, whom
Ted had seen only a few times. Nevertheless, he
was one of his closest friends. They had met on
a night when the boy was hunting, and he could remember
still how they had lain together by the tiny
camp fire, with the coyotes yelping in the distance,
with the great plain stretching out into the dark,
with the slender curl of smoke rising straight upward
and the big stars seeming almost within reach
of his hand in the thin air. The lonely Irishman
had opened his heart to his new friend and had told
him much of his own country, so unlike this big bare
one, a dear green land where the tumbledown cottages
and little fields were crowded together in such
comforting comradeship.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You could open your window of a summer night
and give a call to the neighbors,” he sighed, “and
you needn’t to have the voice of the giant Finn McCoul
to make them hear. In this place a man could
fall sick and die alone and no one be the wiser.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His reminiscences had wandered farther and farther
until he began to tell the tales and legends familiar
in his own countryside, stories of the “Little
People” and of Ireland in ancient times. Of them
all Ted remembered most clearly the story of the
white greyhounds of the King of Connemara, upon
which his friend had dwelt long, showing that in spite
of its being a thousand years old, it was his favorite
tale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Like those dogs on Arran Creek, they were perhaps,”
the Irishman said, “only sleeker of coat and
swifter of foot, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But they couldn’t be faster,” Ted had objected.
“The Arran dogs can catch coyotes and jack-rabbits
and people have called those the quickest
animals that run.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah,” returned the other with true Irish logic,
“those Arran dogs are Russian, they tell me, and
these I speak of were of Connemara, and what comes
out of Ireland you may be sure, is faster and fairer
than anything else on earth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Against such reasoning Ted had judged it impossible
to argue and had dropped into silence and
finally into sleep with the voices of the coyotes and
the legend of the lean, white Irish greyhounds still
running like swift water through his dreams.</p>

<p class='c007'>After that he had visited the lonely shepherd
whenever he could find time to travel so far. Together
they had hunted deer and trapped beaver in
the foothills above the Big Basin or, when the sheep
had to be moved to new pasture, had spent hours in
earnest talk, plodding patiently in the dust after the
slow-moving flock. The long habit of silence had
taken deep hold upon the Irishman, but with Ted
alone he seemed willing to speak freely. It was on
one of these occasions that he had given the boy the
image of Saint Christopher, “For,” he said, “you
are like to be a great roamer and a great traveler
from the way you talk, and those who carry the good
Saint Christopher with them, always travel safely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, as Ted thought of illness and pestilence
spreading across the thinly settled state, his first and
keenest apprehension was for the safety of his friend.
His work done, he went quickly back to the house
where the doctor was already standing on the door-step
again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are not bad cases, either of them,” he was
saying to Ted’s aunt. “If they have good care
there is no danger, but if they don’t—then Heaven
help them, I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ted came close and pulled his sleeve.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me,” he questioned quickly, “Michael
Martin isn’t sick, is he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Michael Martin?” repeated the doctor. “A
big Irishman in the cabin at the upper edge of Big
Basin? Yes, he’s down, sick as can be, poor fellow,
with no one but a gray old collie dog, about the
age of himself, I should think, to keep him company.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He turned back to give a few last directions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose you are master of the house with
your uncle laid up,” he said to Ted again, “and I
will have to apply to you to lend me a fresh horse
so that I can go on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re never going on to-night?” exclaimed
Ted; “why, you have been riding for all you were
worth, all day!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and all the night before,” returned the
doctor cheerfully, “but this is no time to spare
horses or doctors. Good gracious, boy, what’s
that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>For Pedro, tall and white in the dark, standing
on his hind legs to insert an inquisitive puppy nose
between the doctor’s collar and his neck, was an unexpected
and startling apparition.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s my dog,” Ted explained proudly; “Jim
McKenzie, over on Arran Creek, gave him to me; he
has a lot of them, you know. Pedro is only half
grown now, he is going to be a lot bigger when he
is a year old. Yes, I’ll bring you a horse right away,
yours couldn’t go another mile.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When, a few minutes later, the sound of hoofs
came clattering up from the stables it seemed certain
that there were more than four of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s this?” the doctor inquired, seeing a
second horse with saddlebags and blanket roll
strapped in place and observing Ted’s boots and
riding coat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My aunt and the girls will take care of Uncle,”
the boy replied, “so I am going out to see Michael
Martin. You can tell me what to do for him as we
ride up to the trail.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They could feel the sharp wind almost before they
began climbing the ridge. So far, summer had lingered
into November, but the weather was plainly
changing now and there had been reports of heavy
snowfalls in the mountains. The stars shone dimly,
as though through a veil of mist.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You had better push on as fast as you can,” advised
the doctor as they came to the parting of their
ways. “When a man is as sick as Michael, whatever
is to happen, comes quickly.” His horse
jumped and snorted. “There’s that white puppy of
yours again. What a ghost he is! He is rather
big to take with you to a sick man’s cabin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Pedro had come dashing up the trail behind them,
in spite of his having been ordered sternly to stay at
home. At six months old the sense of obedience is
not quite so great as it should be, and the love of going
on an expedition is irresistible.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would take me forever to drive him home
now,” Ted admitted; “I will take him along to Jim
McKenzie’s and leave him there with his brothers.
I can make Arran Creek by breakfast time and ought
to get to Michael’s not long after noon. Well, so
long!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The stars grew more dim and the wind keener as
he rode on through the night. His pony cantered
steadily with the easy rocking-horse motion that came
near to lulling him to sleep. Pedro padded alongside,
his long legs covering the miles with untiring
energy. They stopped at midnight to drink from
the stream they were crossing, to rest a little and to
eat some lunch from the saddlebags. Then they
pressed on once more, on and on, until gray and
crimson began to show behind the mountains to the
eastward, and the big white house of Arran at last
came into sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jim McKenzie’s place was bigger than the ordinary
ranch house, for there were gabled roofs
showing through the group of trees, there were tall
barns and a wide fenced paddock where lived the
white Russian wolfhounds for which the Arran
ranch was famous. A deep-voiced chorus of welcome
was going up as Ted and Pedro came down the
trail. The puppy responded joyfully and went
bounding headlong to the foot of the slope to greet
his brothers. It was a beautiful sight to see the
band of great dogs, their coats like silver in the
early morning light, romping together like a dozen
kittens, pursuing each other in circles, checking,
wheeling, rolling one another over, leaping back and
forth over the low fences that divided the paddock,
with the grace and free agility of deer. Early as it
was, Jim McKenzie was walking down to the stables
and stopped to greet Ted as, weary and dusty, he
rode through the gate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure we’ll keep Pedro,” he said when he had
heard the boy’s errand. “Yes, we’ve a good many
sick here; I’d have sent out on the range myself but
there was nobody to spare. They tell me the herds
of sheep are in terrible confusion, and most of the
herders are down. Poor old Michael Martin, I
hope you get there in time to help him. Turn your
horse into the corral, we’ll give you another to go
on with. Now come in to breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ted snatched a hurried meal, threw his saddle
upon a fresh pony, and set off again. For a long
distance he could hear the lamentations of Pedro
protesting loudly at the paddock gate. The way,
after he passed Arran Creek, led out into the flat
country of the Big Basin with the sagebrush-dotted
plain stretching far ahead. It seemed that he rode
endlessly and arrived nowhere, so long was the way
and so unchanging the landscape. Once, as he
crossed a stream, a deer rose, stamping and snorting
among the low bushes, and fled away toward the
hills, seeming scarcely to touch the ground as it went.
Later, something quick and silent and looking like
a reddish-brown collie, leaped from the sagebrush
and scudded across the trail almost under his horse’s
feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A coyote, out in the open in daylight,” he reflected,
somewhat startled. “It must have been
cold up in the mountains to make them so bold.
That looks bad for the sheep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was disturbing also to see how many scattered
sheep he was beginning to pass, little bands, solitary
ewes with half-grown lambs trotting at their heels,
adventurous yearlings straying farther and farther
from their comrades. Once or twice he tried to
drive them together, but owing to his haste and his
inexperience with their preposterous ways, he had
very little success.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is going to be bad weather, too,” he observed
as he saw the blue sky disappear beneath an
overcast of gray. “I had better get on to Michael’s
as fast as I can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He saw the little mud and log cabin at last, tucked
away among some stunted trees near the shoulder
of a low ridge. It looked deceivingly near, yet he
rode and rode and could not reach it. White flakes
were flying now, fitfully at first, then thicker and
thicker until he could scarcely see. His growing
misgivings gave place to greater and greater anxiety
concerning his friend, while there ran through his
mind again and again, the doctor’s words, “Whatever
is to happen, comes quickly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was past noon and had begun to seem as though
he had been riding forever when he breasted the
final slope at last, jumped from his horse, and thundered
at the cabin door. The whine of a dog answered
him within, and a faint voice, broken but
still audible, told him that Michael was alive.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cabin, so it seemed to him as he entered, was
a good ten degrees colder than it was outside. Poor
Michael, helpless and shivering on the bunk in the
corner, looked like the shrunken ghost of the giant
Irishman he had known before. Ted rekindled the
fire, emptied his saddlebags, piled his extra blankets
upon the bed and, with a skill bred of long practice
in camp cookery, set about preparing a meal.
Michael was so hoarse as to be almost unable to
speak and so weak that his mind wandered in the
midst of a sentence, yet all of his thoughts were on
the care of his sheep.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When I felt the sickness coming on me I tried
to drive them in,” he whispered, “but they broke
and scattered and I fell beside the trail—they must
get in—snow coming—”</p>

<p class='c007'>In an hour his fever rose again, he tossed and
muttered with only fleeting intervals of consciousness.
Ted had found food and shelter for his horse
in the sheep shed, and had settled down to his task
of anxious watching. The snow fell faster and
faster so that darkness came on by mid-afternoon.
He had tried to drive the old collie dog out to herd
in the sheep, but the poor creature would not leave
its master and, even when pushed outside, remained
whining beside the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He couldn’t do much anyway,” sighed Ted as he
let him in again. “How those coyotes yelp! I
wish, after all, that I had brought Pedro.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Michael had heard the coyotes too and was striving
feebly to rise from his bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must go out to them, my poor creatures,” he
gasped. “Those devil beasts will have them driven
over the whole country before morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But he fell back, too weak to move farther, and
was silent a long time. When he did speak it was
almost aloud.</p>

<p class='c007'>“With the cold and the snow, I’m thinking there
will be worse things abroad this night than just the
coyotes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He lay very still while Ted sat beside him, beginning
to feel sleepy and blinking at the firelight.
Eleven o’clock, twelve, one, the slow hands of his
watch pointed to the crawling hours. Michael was
not asleep but he said nothing, he was listening too
intently. It was after one and the boy might have
been dozing, when the old man spoke again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hark,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a moment Ted could hear nothing save the
pat-pat of the snow against the window, but the
collie dog bristled and growled as he lay upon the
hearth and pricked his ears sharply. Then the boy
heard it too, a faint cry and far off, not the sharp
yelping of the coyotes, though that was ominous
enough, but the long hungry howl of a timber wolf.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tears of weakness and terror were running down
the Irishman’s face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My poor sheep, I must save them,” he cried.
“What’s the value of a man’s life alongside of the
creatures that’s trusted to him. Those murderers
will have every one of them killed for me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ted jumped up quickly and bundled on his coat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where’s your rifle, Michael?” he asked. “I
don’t know much about sheep, but I will do what I
can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The rifle?” returned Michael doubtfully.
“Now, I had it on my shoulder the day I went out
with the sickness on me, and it is in my mind that I
did not bring it home again. But there is the little
gun hanging on the nail; there’s no more shells for
it but there’s two shots still left in the chamber.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy took down the rusty revolver and spun
the cylinder with a practiced finger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two shots is right,” he said, “and you have no
more shells? Well, two shots may scare a wolf.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If Michael had been in his proper senses, Ted
very well knew, he would never have permitted without
protest such an expedition as the boy was planning.
As it was, however, he lay back in his bunk
again, his mind wandering off once more into feverish
dreams.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it was in the Old Country,” he muttered, “the
very Little People themselves would rise up to help
a man in such a plight. You could be feeling the
rush of their wings in the air and could hear the
cry of the fairy hounds across the hills. America is
a good country, but ah—it’s not the same!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hoping to quiet him, Ted took the little Saint
Christopher from his pocket and laid it in the sick
man’s hand. Then he finished strapping his big
boots, opened the door and slipped out quietly.
Michael scarcely noticed his going.</p>

<p class='c007'>The snow had fallen without drifting much, nor
was it yet very deep. He hurried down the slope,
not quite knowing what he was to do, thinking that
at least he would gather as many sheep as he could
and drive them homeward. But there were no sheep
to be found. Where so many had been scattered
that afternoon there was now not one. The whole
of the Big Basin seemed suddenly to have emptied
of them. Presently, however, he found a broad
trail of trampled snow which he followed, where it
led along a tiny stream at the foot of the ridge. As
he turned, he heard again that long, terrifying howl
coming down the wind. The sheep, perverse enough
to scatter to the four winds when their master sought
to drive them in, had now, it seemed, gathered of
their own will when so great a danger threatened.
Ted came upon them at last, huddled together in a
little ravine where the sparse undergrowth gave
some shelter from the snow. He could just see
them in the dim light, their gray compact bodies
crowded close, their foolish black faces seeming to
look up piteously to him for help. They were very
quiet, although now and then they would shift a little,
stamp, and move closer. The cry of the wolf was
stilled at last, but not because the fierce marauder was
not drawing nearer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes, as he stood watching, there slipped a swift
dark shape over the opposite edge of the hollow and
flung itself upon a straggling ewe on the outskirts
of the flock. It was followed by a second silent
shadow, and a third. The poor sheep gave only
one frantic bleat, then all was still again save for the
sound of a hideous snapping and tearing, of a furious
struggle muffled in the soft depths of the snow.
Ted raised the revolver and took careful aim, he
pulled the trigger, but no explosion followed. Michael’s
improvidence in letting his stock dwindle to
only two cartridges might be counted upon also to
have let those two be damp. Helplessly the boy
spun the cylinder and snapped the hammer again
and again, but to no purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sheep was down now, with one of the savage
hunters standing over it, another tearing at its
throat while the third was slipping along the edge
of the flock selecting a fresh victim. Ted’s weapon
was useless, yet he must do something, he could not
stand and see the whole herd destroyed before his
eyes. Perhaps he could frighten them away as one
could coyotes: he was so angry at this senseless,
brutal slaughter that he lost all sense of prudence.
He waved his arms up and down and shouted at the
top of his lungs. He saw the creatures drop their
prey and turn to look up at him. He ran along the
slope, still shouting, then, of a sudden, stepped into
an unexpected hollow, lost his balance and fell headlong.
One of the wolves left the flock and came
creeping swiftly toward him, its belly dragging in the
snow.</p>

<p class='c007'>His cry must have carried far in the quiet of the
night for it was answered from a great way off. A
deep voice broke the stillness and another, the call
of coursing hounds who have winded their quarry
but have not yet found its trail. And mingled with
the barking chorus there rose high the joyful yelp
of a puppy who seeks his beloved master.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ted, slipping in the snow, struggled to his knees
and called again and again. The stealthy, approaching
shadow crept a yard nearer, then paused to lift a
gray muzzle and sniff the air. The second wolf,
with slobbering bloody jaws, turned to listen, the
flock of sheep snorted and stamped in the snow. A
minute passed, then another. The boy managed to
get to his feet. Then across the edge of the hollow,
white against the dark underbrush, he saw the dogs
coming, a line of swift, leaping forms, huge, shaggy
and beautiful, their great voices all giving tongue
together. Down the slope they came like an avalanche,
one only separating himself from the others
for a moment to fling himself upon Ted, to lick his
face in ecstatic greeting and to rub a cold nose against
his cheek. That nimble puppy nose it was that had
lifted the latch of a gate not too securely fastened,
and so set the whole pack free. Then Pedro ran
to join his brothers who were sweeping on to battle.
Wolfhounds are taught to catch, not to kill their
quarry, but the thirst for blood was in the hearts of
the dogs of Arran that night. There was only a moment
of struggle, a few choking cries, and the fight
was over.</p>

<p class='c007'>Day broke next morning, clear and bright, with
the chinook blowing, the big warm wind that melts
the snows and lays the white hills bare almost in an
hour. Michael Martin, fallen into a proper sleep
at last, woke suddenly and sat up in his bunk. He
startled Ted, who, rather stiff and sore from his
night’s adventures, was kneeling by the fire preparing
breakfast. The boy came quickly to his patient’s
side to inquire how he did.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s better I am in body,” the Irishman answered;
“indeed I begin to feel almost like a whole man
again. But—” he shook his head sadly, “my poor
wits, they’re gone away entirely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What can you mean?” Ted demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Michael sighed deeply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After you were gone last night,” he answered,
“even my wandering senses had an inkling of what
a dangerous errand it was, and I got up from my bed
and stumbled to the window to call you back. Yes,
the sickness has made me daft entirely, for as sure
as I live, I saw the white greyhounds of Connemara
go over the hill. But daft or no—” he sniffed at
the odor of frying bacon that rose from the hearth,
“I am going to relish my breakfast this day. Eh,
glory me, if there isn’t another of the creatures now!”</p>

<p class='c007'>For Pedro, once more applying a knowing muzzle
to the clumsy latch, had pushed open the door and
stood upon the step, wagging and apologetic, the
morning sun shining behind him. Long-legged and
awkward, he stepped over the threshold and came to
the bedside to sniff inquisitively at the little silver
image that lay on the blanket. Michael could never
be persuaded to believe otherwise than that Saint
Christopher had brought him.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Betsey went, two days later, along
the hill road again she walked far more
quickly and did not hesitate at the
turning of the lane. She was on her way to Aunt
Susan’s to announce her determination and she felt,
this time, neither irresolution nor reluctance. She
went firmly up the graveled drive, asked the grave
butler whether her aunt were at home, and, waiting
in the big, impressive drawing room, even heard
the approaching rustle of Aunt Susan’s elaborate silk
skirts without feeling her courage give way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have made up my mind not to go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She got it out quickly, almost before a word of
greeting had passed. “My father wants me to go
to college and my mother did, too. If I should
leave my work now I feel sure I would not do what
I have planned. So—so I must stay.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no need for her to say how much she
wished for the journey. She felt, in fact, that it was
wise to say as little as possible and to bend all her
efforts to resisting the storm of arguments and
protests that would be poured out upon her. Aunt
Susan was a person much accustomed to having her
own way and was dangerously skillful at persuading
people to do her bidding.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Think how lonely you will be,” she began immediately.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once this had been the single thought that
made staying at home seem unendurable, but now
even that difficulty, it seemed, could be faced. In
one short afternoon at Miss Miranda’s, Elizabeth
had felt herself surrounded by such a warmth of
friendliness that already she felt certain that here
would be a refuge where she would be welcome and
at home, no matter how empty and deserted her own
house might seem. To come home from school,
weary with the labors of the day and find no one
there save Anna, busy in the kitchen and not wishing
to be disturbed, to have no one glad to see her or
desirous of knowing just how things had gone—it
had seemed a depressing prospect. But now that
she knew Miss Miranda it was somehow different.
Elizabeth could not have explained just why she felt,
after only an hour or two of acquaintance, after
only a little talk, that here was a friend to stand by
her through everything. Feel it she did, however,
and with the knowledge, made firm her decision.
But to hold to that decision was not so easy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was absolutely certain that you would come
with me,” Aunt Susan exclaimed, trying a new point
of attack. “I had even decided what clothes you
were to have. Your traveling suit was to be green
faille silk with white furs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey had before had experience with dresses
planned by Aunt Susan. They were apt to be of
the sort in which you could not run upstairs, or that
split their sleeves if you raised your arms suddenly,
but they were always very beautiful. She sighed a
little at the thought of the white furs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I dare say you could go to school here and
there in places where we stopped long enough,” her
aunt went on; “that ought to be all you need for
keeping up your work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She had not been to college herself and had not
grasped the fact that dropping in upon one school
and then another could fail to produce all the education
necessary. Elizabeth tried to explain, but found
it useless. She wished that, having stated her determination,
she could go home at once, for the
longer she stayed the more irresistible and enticing
did the journey seem. She had rashly consented to
stay to dinner, however, and so must prepare for a
long struggle. The dinner was half enjoyable on
account of the beautiful things on the table, silver
and flowers and frail china that Betsey loved, and
half terrifying on account of the things that Aunt
Susan might be going to say next. She said a great
deal, she exclaimed, she expostulated, she persuaded,
until her niece was at the point of exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it will be so dreary, all by yourself!” she
kept insisting, in answer to which Betsey continued
to maintain stoutly—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Miranda is going to be a good friend to
me. I will not be entirely alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean Miranda Reynolds who lives on
the hill, up Somerset Lane?” Aunt Susan inquired.
“I am very fond of her myself, but somehow I never
seem to see much of her nowadays. How do you
happen to know her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She came to see me, but I was a long time in going
there to return her visit. I did not know how
nice her house was, or how kind she would be, or
what interesting things she would tell me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not suppose,” returned Aunt Susan slowly,
with a shade of curiosity in her voice, “that she told
you how she happens to be living in a gardener’s
cottage and cooking and scrubbing and tending cabbages
and ducks when she might be doing—oh,
very different things?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” answered Betsey, “no, she did not tell me
that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now that she thought of it, there were a great
many things that Miss Miranda had not told her.
She knew very little of her new friend and, in spite
of questionings among acquaintances of her own
age, seemed unable to learn more. She had discovered
only that Miss Miranda dwelt in the cottage
alone with her father, that she had a big vegetable
garden on the sunny slope of the hill, that she kept
ducks and chickens and, by her untiring industry,
managed to make the household prosper. Elizabeth
could well believe that to whatever she turned her
hand, that thing would be successful.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Her father was quite a great man in his day,”
her aunt went on thoughtfully. “He had a good
deal of a name as an expert in scientific mechanics.
One never hears of him now. I suppose he does not
accomplish much since he has grown old. I am continually
thinking that I will go over to see Miranda,
yet I have so many engagements that I never do.
She sent me some delightful asparagus from her
garden lately; I have meant to give her some of
Simmonds’ grapes in return. You can leave them
there to-night when the motor takes you home. Yes,
you will have a good friend in her, but you are very
wrong and foolish not to go with me, just the same.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As Elizabeth, leaning back in the big car, rolled
along the smooth road on her way home, she could
not help wondering how it would be to have just
such luxury at her command for the next few months,
to travel in splendor with Aunt Susan and to see all
the wonderful things of which she had just heard
such dazzling description.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not too late yet, if you want to change your
mind,” had been her aunt’s last words. Betsey was
nearer to wavering at this moment than ever before.
The thought of the still, empty house to which she
was coming home, seemed suddenly very dreary indeed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The car stopped at the Reynolds’ gate and Elizabeth
went in herself with the basket of grapes. The
curtains were not drawn, so that she could see Miss
Miranda sitting with her work beside the table.
She could even see her look up, startled and alarmed
as she had been before, when there came a step at
the door. She was so calm, so quiet and cheerful in
all other matters it was hard to imagine why this
one thing should trouble her so. After the basket
was delivered, Elizabeth lingered at the door, unwilling
to say good night, while Miss Miranda, too,
seemed reluctant to have her go. When at last Betsey
took her departure and the car moved away from
the gate, she found that her wavering doubts, felt so
keenly at Aunt Susan’s, had vanished again. She
would not be too lonely if she had Miss Miranda,
of that she now felt doubly assured; but there was
something more. She had an odd, protective feeling
for her new friend, as though she were staying at
home, not only to carry out her own plans, but to
take care of Miss Miranda.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is sometimes a vague knowledge of things
that comes without words. It was clear enough to
Elizabeth, long afterwards, just what heavy trouble
was brooding over the little household of the cottage,
and just what part she was destined to play in
dispelling it. Yet it was curious indeed, that she
should have begun to feel, so early and so distinctly,
that here she was really needed and that here she
would give, in return for Miss Miranda’s friendship,
not only small services but great ones.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sunny garden on the hillside was being planted
on the afternoon that she came to the cottage again.
She had said good-by to Aunt Susan that morning
and had seen her depart in a great flutter of veils
and furs and feathers. The train had rolled away
carrying with it Betsey’s last vision of snow-capped
mountains, sparkling blue seas, tropical shores and
white, flower-crowned cliffs. Her mind would still
linger, in spite of herself, on the pleasures that she
had renounced so that she was glad to find some
absorbing diversion and to turn her abundant energy
to helping Miss Miranda.</p>

<p class='c007'>The peas were already pushing their pert green
noses through the warm soil, and the scattered lettuce
plants showed all along the row. Betsey became
so entranced with the task of setting out beans that
she would have filled the whole garden with them
had not Miss Miranda warned her that there must
be a little space left for beets and carrots and sweet
corn.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Michael Martin, bent and weatherbeaten, the
hero of the tale she had heard on her first visit, was
at work spading the far end of the garden. He
seemed a silent, crabbed person, who did not like
to answer even when spoken to, so that Betsey found
him rather disappointing. He would stop his work
now and then, however, to hurl a few words of
rather bewildering advice at the two among the bean
rows.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you are to plant lettuce again, Miss Miranda,”
he remarked suddenly, standing with both hands resting
on his spade, “you had best be doing it to-day.
It is the very last of the light of the moon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What does he mean?” inquired Elizabeth in an
undertone when he had gone on with his work again.
She had no notion that moonlight need be considered
in the matter of growing vegetables.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He thinks that everything in a garden goes by
signs and wonders,” Miss Miranda answered. “He
says charms for luck when he puts in the cabbage
plants, and he thinks that if the first peas are not
sown on Saint Patrick’s Day, they will none of them
come up at all. It is high time to set out the onions
to-day, but he would be so disturbed at putting them
in before the dark of the moon that I have not the
heart to insist on it. All crops that grow under
ground, he claims, must be planted in the dark of the
moon, and those that ripen above, some time between
its waxing and waning. So to-day is the day for
lettuce and next week he will plant potatoes and
beets and carrots and after I have tended them like
babies all summer he will nod wisely when they grow
big and say, ‘Oh, yes, of course they can’t help
flourishing if you plant the right things in the dark
and the light of the moon.’ But it does happen to
be a good day for the lettuce. I am afraid that I
have left the seeds on the kitchen table.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elizabeth volunteered to get them, and went up
the path from the garden, past the big pen where
the ducks and chickens were, and where a dozen
brown-yellow ducklings were waddling solemnly
forth on their first expedition into the outside world.
She stopped to drive them back and then went on,
across the lawn, to the open door of the cottage.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she first came up the lane that day, she had
noticed that the same big white horse that she had
seen in the poplar-bordered cart track was now
plowing in the field opposite the Reynolds’ cottage.
It was guided by the same red-haired boy, who went
plodding up and down the rows, leaving behind them
a straight, blue-black ribbon of upturned soil. She
stopped to watch for a moment as they came near the
fence and she thought that he looked up and saw
her, for she caught sight of a pair of very blue eyes
and a fair, much-freckled face.</p>

<p class='c007'>As she paused, however, there arose suddenly in
the workshop wing of the cottage, such a wild crashing,
such a commotion of whirring wheels and creaking
machinery that she flew to the door to see what
had happened. The crow’s voice mingled with the
din, upraised in caws of loud excitement, while finally,
during a faint lull, Mr. Reynolds was also to be
heard, calling in the familiar tone of worried helplessness—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miranda, oh, Miranda.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At first she could not make out what was happening,
so full did the place seem to be of flapping
black wings, whirling wheels and spinning pulleys.
At last, however, she managed to understand that
one of the big machines at the end of the shop was
in violent motion and that a broken rod was flying
round and round with the spinning wheel, smashing
and crashing against everything that came in its
way. Even in the midst of the noise Mr. Reynolds
must have heard Elizabeth come in, for he glanced
at her quickly over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Climb up on that stool and throw the switch
there above the workbench,” he directed. “That
is the only way to stop this thing and I can’t leave
the broken crank-shaft.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Even in her haste Betsey noticed how quiet and
cool he was, and with what quick skill he was adjusting
valves and closing cylinder cocks, all the time
keeping out of the way of the plunging and slashing
of the broken rod. The switch was so stiff that she
tugged at it to no purpose; she jerked and struggled
but without effect. Mr. Reynolds looked back at
her anxiously as the whirring and crashing grew
every moment more violent. She thought of Miss
Miranda, but she was far away in the garden and
perhaps would not have sufficient strength, nor would
Michael. With sudden inspiration she jumped
down and sped through the door and across the
lawn. The boy and his white horse were just turning
a furrow beside the fence, only the breadth of
the road away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come quickly,” she called in unceremonious
haste. “We need you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy dropped his reins, left the horse standing
in the furrow and vaulted over the fence. His face,
his white shirt and his blue trousers were all coated
alike with dust but she noted with satisfaction how
broad his shoulders were and how quickly he moved.
In one second he was at the door, in another seemed
to know entirely what to do. The stiff handle
groaned as he jerked the switch and flung it over to
break the current, the wildly spinning wheels began
to slow down and finally, imperceptibly, came to rest.
The old man turned about to thank them, his gray
eyes under heavy white brows, alight with high excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you have an accident?” Betsey inquired
breathlessly. “I don’t understand what happened.
Are you hurt?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The rod caught me a crack across the knuckles
when it first gave way, but it does not signify,” he
replied cheerily.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy had come nearer and was examining the
machine with what seemed a practiced eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a flaw in the steel, I suppose,” he said.
“But what is this machine? I never saw anything
like it before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Reynolds began explaining as fully as though
the stranger were a fellow engineer, just how he was
trying to perfect a new power engine that would run
on less fuel than the old ones. “For,” he said, “as
there grows to be less and less of coal and oil in the
world, men must be keeping their wits alive to improve
mechanics and keep the wheels of industry
turning.” The boy became more and more interested,
asking quick questions and receiving eager answers.
Elizabeth began to feel a little left out as
technical terms flew back and forth concerning
things she did not understand. She stood soothing
black Dick who, still excited, was talking to himself
in a corner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have tried a good many models,” Mr. Reynolds
was saying, “but this one is the newest and it
developed so much more power than I expected, that
it came near to tearing itself to pieces before you
came to my rescue. If it had been wrecked I should
have had to begin all over again at the beginning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe you should not have tried it when you
were all alone,” commented Betsey sagely. “You
should have made sure that some one was within
call.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old man smiled, a gentle smile lit with the
warmth of much affection.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought it better to try it when Miranda was
not in the house,” he answered. “If it had refused
to run I did not want any one to know of it. My
daughter is always very quick to see when I am disappointed,
and I do not like to give her pain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He took up a wrench to loosen a bolt but found
it jammed and immovable. With ready skill the
boy took the tool from him and unscrewed the obstinate
nut.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the way,” questioned the old man, “ought I
to remember your name? Have I ever seen you
before?”</p>

<p class='c007'>His confessed absent-mindedness was so disarming
that the boy laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Miranda knows me,” he said, “but you
have never seen me, at least you have never noticed
me. My name is David Warren, and I am staying
with my uncle who owns the place on the east side
of this hill. He is farming a great part of it this
year and finds labor so difficult to get that I am
working for him for the spring and summer. And I
think old Dobbin will be wondering where I have
gone and will be dragging his plow all across the
field. You have a wonderful thing here, this machine.
I—I would like to come and see it run
again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was out of the door and across the road before
a word could be said to thank him. Elizabeth,
still feeling rather dazed with the suddenness of the
whole affair, returned to her forgotten errand of
fetching the lettuce seeds, which Miss Miranda
would surely be needing by now. However, on coming
back to the garden, she found that her long absence
had been scarcely noticed. The brown ducklings
had escaped again and even Michael had been
obliged to put down his spade and go in pursuit of
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shoo, ye varmints,” he was saying, as the fat
balls of down, their lemon-colored bills wide open in
faint baby quackings, went scuttling in a dozen different
directions from between his feet. “You
might know they would be wild creatures, they were
hatched out in a thunderstorm!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The afternoon had been cheerful, but the evening
was long and lonely, with Anna plunged into one of
her blackest moods. Yet, though the hours dragged,
they did not suffice for the mastering of to-morrow’s
lesson. Geometry and history were Betsey’s two
great difficulties, so great indeed that, with the college
examinations coming nearer, they began vaguely
to threaten real disaster. She sighed as she turned
for the tenth time to the worn page in her textbook,
dealing with the volume of the frustum of a pyramid.
She knew the drawing and the text drearily
by heart, but would she ever understand it? Would
the looming bulk of this misshapen figure grow bigger
and bigger until it blocked her road to higher
education? As she crept away to bed she was thinking
that it was only that morning that Aunt Susan
had left her, proclaiming to the last Betsey’s mistaken
foolishness in remaining behind. Perhaps,
after all, Aunt Susan had been right!</p>

<p class='c007'>She awoke next morning still depressed, more discouraged
than ever when her eye fell upon the cover
of her geometry book. It would be a good plan
to set off for school early, she decided, and go around
by Somerset Lane for a cheering moment of talk
with Miss Miranda. Her heart felt lighter as soon
as she thought of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>As she turned in at the gate her glance swept the
field across the way, but found it empty. No sturdy
white horse was plowing it to-day, no erect, copper-haired
figure was visible, only rows of furrows,
drying in the sun. The little house, also, seemed
unusually quiet as she first rang at the bell, then went
across the grass to knock at the kitchen door. She
could hear Mr. Reynolds tinkering in the shop, she
could see Michael’s bent back where he was toiling
alone in the garden. She saw, presently, when the
door opened, the unattractive face of a totally
strange woman who was apparently presiding over
Miss Miranda’s kitchen. In the fewest and shortest
words possible the stranger explained to Betsey
that Miss Miranda was gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gone? Gone where? For how long?” cried
Elizabeth in unbearable disappointment.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she received no answer for the woman had
already closed the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>Spring had advanced to that season of damp,
hot, sunny days and rainy nights when all
things are growing at such speed that shrubs
and trees are top-heavy with their new green
shoots and are easily shaken by the wind, while
people feel restless and uneasy and would like to be
doing something different from the tasks before
them. Elizabeth often found school dull and oppressive,
with the air of the room close, with her
feet shuffling beneath her desk from the long hours
of quiet and with her thoughts wandering so far
away that the page of her book was only a blur before
her. Every day, when she walked home, she
would make a detour up Somerset Lane just to look
at the cottage, to notice how green the vegetable
garden was growing, how the pea vines were tall
enough to be swinging in the wind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once she came across Mr. Reynolds, strolling on
the lawn for a breath of air, Dick perched in solemn
state upon his shoulder. She questioned him at
once as to Miss Miranda’s term of absence and what
her sudden departure might mean.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not quite understand it myself,” he answered,
seeming to be as distressed as Betsey in his
vague, absent-minded way. “She seemed to decide
on going very much of a sudden, but—I do not
quite know—it appears to me that she had been a
little uneasy for some time, a little troubled when
people came suddenly to the door. Well, well, perhaps
the journey will quiet her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He turned to go back to his shop. He did not
invite Betsey to enter, probably, indeed, he had forgotten
all about her the moment he crossed the doorstep.</p>

<p class='c007'>There came Friday afternoon a month, it seemed,
from the last Friday, when Miss Miranda had gone
away. As Elizabeth walked along the lane, feeling
the air hot and heavy with coming rain, she hesitated
a moment at the turning, listening to the muttered
thunder in the distance and knowing that a
downpour was not far off. From the breathlessness
of the whole world about her and the increasing
blackness overhead, she realized that this was to
be no such spring shower as had once delayed her
on that same road, but a real and furious thunderstorm.
Yet she could not refrain from turning up
the hill, so anxious was she to know whether or not
Miss Miranda had returned. She felt hopeful at
least of getting, through Mr. Reynolds’ vague answers
to her questions, or from Michael’s grunted yes
or no, some information as to when the mistress of
the house might be expected. There was no one in
sight to-day, however, for the lawn was vacant, the
garden empty and the windows closed and blank as
though even Mr. Reynolds and the sour woman in
the kitchen had deserted the place. She lingered at
the gate, lonely and disappointed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll walk down through the garden and see how
the onions and the ducks are getting on,” she said
to herself. “It’s not going to rain so very soon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew at heart that this was not true, that the
tenseness of the air meant that the storm must break
any moment, and that the boiling clouds just becoming
visible over the edge of the hill contained
thunder and lightning and a deluge of rain. Nevertheless
she pressed on, anxious to be of service to
her friend, thinking that there might be some young
chickens to rescue or some wayward ducklings to
drive in out of the storm. Reaching the gate of
the poultry yard she found that the motherly old
hens had been as thoughtful as she, for they had
long since hustled their young charges under shelter,
leaving only the old red cock to strut about the place
and cast his eye upward at the threatening clouds.
She was leaning over the gate, laughing at his absurd
dignity, when the whole sky above her was
streaked with a blinding flash of light and the very
hill seemed to rock under the following thunder.
The big drops began to fall, faster and faster, until
a white sheet of rain swept across the garden almost
before she could seek refuge in the open door of the
tool shed.</p>

<p class='c007'>How it poured, so that trickling streams were
running down the paths and pools were collecting
before her very feet! What was it doing to the
garden laid out on the long slope, all that flood of
water rushing from the top of the hill to the valley
below? A good many times she had heard Michael
comment to Miss Miranda on just such a possibility.</p>

<p class='c007'>“’Tis a good bit of ground you have, but steeper
by far than it should be. In grass it was well
enough, but in garden stuff, I’m not so certain. A
hard rain on this hillside would cut the rows and
wash out the young plants something cruel. I wish
it were more of a level.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Just what he had dreaded was evidently happening
now. Rain and wind rushed furiously over the garden,
flattening the peas, tearing at the furrows,
plowing deep trenches where rivulets of water
went streaming down. Once in a quieter shower she
had seen Michael working with a hoe, opening
proper channels to carry off the rain, making little
ditches here and there where the water could flow
away without doing harm. It was plain that if the
garden was to be saved from the ravages of this
seasonable storm, some such thing must be done
now.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” she thought determinedly, “I wasn’t
of much use in the workshop, but I can do something
here at least.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It had rankled a little for some days after that
other emergency, to remember that it was David and
not herself, who had been of service.</p>

<p class='c007'>She took a hoe from behind the door and ran out
into the rain. In a moment her hat was blown away,
her clothes were soaked and water was streaming
down her face. She struggled valiantly with the
torrents that were pouring through the garden. At
first she was slow and awkward, but presently she
gained skill by experiment so that she could open
channels where they were most needed and could
forestall the cutting of cruel gashes all across the
rows of the best vegetables. Energy and good will
she had in plenty and with abundance of these she
toiled, wet, muddy, slipping in the crumbling soil,
thinking sometimes that she was beaten but still
fighting desperately to rescue what she could. At
last slowly, very slowly, the struggle turned from
a losing battle to a winning one, the proper ditches
were made and maintained, the rain softened from
a deluge to a quiet shower, the water flowed harmlessly
away between the corn and the cabbages and
Betsey stopped to draw breath and survey what she
had done. The peas and onions showed unbroken
rows, the beans had been little damaged, the bulk
of the garden’s crop had been saved. It was only
then that she realized how excited she had been and
how wet and weary she was. She jumped with
startled suddenness when a voice spoke behind her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve done that none so bad,” it said slowly.
“There’s not many that’s so willing to keep a garden
from being ruined by the rain and fewer yet
would have the wits to know how.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She turned to see Michael Martin sitting on an
upturned bucket, smoking calmly away at his stump
of a black pipe, rain dripping from the rim of his
battered hat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I remembered seeing you carry off the rain in
the same way last week,” Betsey answered, “so I
thought I’d try it myself. But I didn’t know that
you were anywhere near.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was but an April shower,” he rejoined,
“such as a stiff old man could get the better of, but
I’ve known this long time that I wasn’t able any
more to fight one of these unseasonable thunderstorms.
The ground here lies well for the sun but
ill for the rain, as I’m always telling Miss Miranda.
She’ll be glad and thankful that you have saved her
crop! And how it did rain, as though it were Saint
Swithin’s Day itself!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And how long have you been sitting there?”
demanded Betsey. “You might at least have told
me what to do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I came out thinking to try what I could myself,
but when I saw you at the work, I could tell that
you knew what you were about, so where was the
use of wasting any words. I just waited in case
you needed any help, but you managed better alone
than with an old man to hinder. I’ve no doubt that
your hands are blistered and that you’ll find your
back aching to-morrow, but you have saved the garden.
It will be something Miss Reynolds will be
glad to hear when she comes home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is she coming soon? Where did she go?”
Elizabeth inquired eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now that I don’t know,” Michael answered with
a sigh. “She decided within an hour and off she
went. It might have been to consult her cousin that
looks after her business affairs and that used to live
here when he was a boy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What was her cousin’s name?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The rain had almost ceased, so Elizabeth laid
aside her hoe, stretched her cramped fingers and
went to stand in front of Michael and ply him with
questions. Such a talkative mood was so rare in
him that she feared, any second, it might pass away,
and, since here at last was some one who could and
would tell her more of Miss Miranda, she trembled
lest silence should come suddenly upon him before
she had heard what she wished to know. The rain
was pattering from her skirts, her feet sank every
moment deeper into the mud, but she feared to move
or turn away lest the spell should break. Good
fortune seemed to be with her, however, for Michael
talked on and on, relighting his pipe as often as the
water quenched it, and answering her queries to the
best of his ability.</p>

<p class='c007'>“His name was Don, Mr. Donald Reynolds he
is now, and I find it hard to remember when I see
him, that they were ever little things here together
and he was her Cousin Don. I never liked the lad,
and began to mistrust him from the first I knew of
him, when his face was just beginning to look keen
and sharp and he was learning to think it was a great
joke that he could so easily get the better of the
other two, Miss Miranda and Mr. Ted, and shape
things to go all his way. Now he is rich and prosperous
and beginning to grow fat, but still he has
that sharp, selfish face. He has forgotten how to
be kind to Miss Miranda, he has forgotten how
good she was to him when he was a snub-nosed boy
with long legs and skinned knees and the both of
them with no mother. Yes, he has forgotten all
that, has Mr. Donald Reynolds.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you think she has gone somewhere to consult
him?” Elizabeth asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She goes to see him rarely, more often he comes
here. And she dreads his coming always. I begin
to know when it is time for another visit from
him, when she starts at the creaking of the gate and
begins to look frightened when she hears a step coming
up the path. She has been in worse uneasiness
than ever, these last weeks, so I’m thinking she just
decided that it was better to dare than to dread, so
she was off to see him and have it over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But why,” persisted Betsey, “why should she
be afraid of her own cousin when he grew up with
her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s past my understanding,” Michael admitted,
“and I’ve thought and wondered over it until my
mind was all at sea. I’m not of her kind, so it’s a
puzzle that I can’t solve. It has something to do
with her old father, and that machine he is making,
that far I have got, but no farther. He is a clever
one, the old man; he has been famous once and I’ll
wager you, when that piece of work is done, he will
make the world talk of him again. But there’s
something wrong and if one but knew what it was,
maybe it could be put right. When I knew them
first they were all so happy, living there in the big
house at the summit of the hill, they seemed to have
everything in life there was to wish for, but since
then the house has burned and Mr. Ted has gone
away to the wars, and there’s things gone badly
awry. Miss Miranda doesn’t pretend that this big
garden and these ducks and hens are here for her
own pleasure, she owns that she must have the money
that she makes by them, but it’s my belief that not
even you and I know how much she needs it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His damp pipe, rebellious at last, refused to be
rekindled, which delayed him for a long minute.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has cut herself off from most of her old
friends,” he went on, when he was once more puffing
vigorously, “for fear they might be asking questions
or offering help in a way that would hurt her.
She is too proud to endure either. But—” he
raised his little gray eyes and looked at Betsey
keenly, “but you’re of a different sort, the sort that
she does not fear and that can be a true friend to
her none the less. She is fond of you, I’ve seen that
in these days you have worked with her in the garden.
Be good to her, Miss Betsey, and stay near
to her. Find out her trouble if you can and help
her. For it’s as true as that there are Saints in
Heaven, it’s help she needs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He got up as though all that he had been saying
had led up to this and now he had finished.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—” gasped Betsey, “but, please tell me
first—”</p>

<p class='c007'>His square jaw shut so firmly that she knew there
was no use in going on. The strange mood of fluent
speech had left him. Pocketing his pipe and
pulling his wet hat down over his forehead, he
stumped off down the muddy furrow, never looking
back. The rain had ceased entirely now and the
sun had come breaking through the clouds with that
brilliant clearness that often follows a storm. It
made the drenched green rows glisten and the new
corn, bowing before the wind, sparkle and drop
jewels as the gusts passed by. Betsey slowly lifted
one heavy foot out of the mud and then the other,
and walked very thoughtfully up the path.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Saturday and Sunday she went away into the
country with some friends of her own age to stay at
a distant country place and to spend the quick hours
in very happy holiday-making, returning to school
on Monday morning with more energy and cheerfulness
than she had known for a week. Affairs of
various kinds kept her occupied so late that it was
not until the long daylight hour after dinner that she
was free to hasten away up Somerset Lane. As she
came to the gate she saw with delight that there were
lights in the upper windows, that the doors stood
open and that the whole place had a more cheerful
look than it had recently worn. Even Dick, sitting
on the gate post and conversing with himself in
happy gutturals, seemed trying to announce that the
mistress of the house was once more at home.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miranda said nothing of her journey except
to thank Elizabeth most warmly and gratefully for
saving the garden in her absence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You should hear Michael sing your praises,”
she said. “He has so little to say of any one that
it is amazing to hear how he talks of you. He cannot
make up his mind whether we have saved our
season’s crop through your resourcefulness or because
last week he buried a luckpenny at the head of
the garden. But I know what I think!”</p>

<p class='c007'>They went out together to inspect the whole
place, to wonder at the growth of the vegetables
after the rain, and to admire the plumpness of the
ducks and the white Leghorn chicks, hatched while
Miss Miranda was away. Betsey noticed that her
friend still looked worn and anxious and that the
old trick of looking quickly over her shoulder when
a step went past the gate, was not gone. But of
her journey she still said nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think,” Miss Miranda remarked at last, “that
it would be pleasant to walk over to the big house—or
where the big house stood—and look at the
flowers there. The peonies should be out by now.
I was thinking of them to-day, of how cool and white
they were and what banks of them should be blooming
under the dining-room windows. The air feels
close to-night, but there is nearly always a breeze
stirring under the pine trees across the slope of the
hill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The high gray wall that edged the lawn by the
cottage was, as Elizabeth knew, the boundary of the
grounds belonging to the big, ruined house. She
had looked often at the gate, with its round archway,
but she had never passed through it and into
the crooked path beyond. The lock was rusty and
difficult to turn, she noted, as though Miss Miranda
did not often pass that way herself. She felt a flutter
of excitement as they went through the gate,
feeling that she was about to explore some of those
mysteries that had been puzzling more people than
herself alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The peonies were out indeed, great white drifts
of them in a long row below a broken wall. It was
not easy to realize that the heaps of blackened
stones, covered with vines and lusty wild shrubs, had
ever stood for a real dwelling with dining and living
rooms and windows opening on the garden. Just
facing them, was a stretch of wall still partly unbroken,
showing a few windows and a door, charred
and blackened by the cruel fire, but still firm on its
hinges. A very old cherry tree with a twisted black
trunk spread its branches just above. It gave Betsey
a creepy feeling to look at that closed entrance
and think what ruin and desolation lay behind it.</p>

<p class='c007'>What had been the lawn was still green and
smooth, bordered by a great half circle of pine trees.
In the very center of the level stretch of turf was a
broad round pool of clear water with a rim of cool
gray stone just showing in the thick grass. There
was a breeze as Miss Miranda had promised, a
gentle wind that moved the heavy branches of the
pines and touched the surface of the water. Elizabeth
knelt in the grass to peer into the basin, to
watch a few lazy fish swimming here and there and
to see the mirrored green of the tree-tops all about
the edge, with a circle of blue sky reflected in the
center.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You should see it a little later, after dark,”
said Miss Miranda, leaning over her shoulder to
look in also. “That opening between the two biggest
trees gives space to reflect the sunset and show
the evening star. My father taught me all the stars
by showing them to me in the pool; even now I think
of June as the time when the Northern Crown shines
there in the middle of the basin and of August as
when the Swan spreads her wings from one edge to
the other.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps Miss Miranda realized suddenly that she
had said more than she intended, for never before
had she dropped a hint that this great ruined place
had once been her home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look at old Dick,” she observed as though to
forestall any questioning; “I thought that he would
be coming after us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The solemn figure of the crow came hopping along
the path, pausing to peer under stones or behind
bushes for snails. With great dignity he stepped
across the grass to sit on the rim of the pool.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it deep?” Elizabeth asked, looking down into
the quiet water that reflected Dick’s image so clearly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is at one side, but not at the other,” Miss
Miranda answered. “Just here you can touch the
bottom if you stretch your arm, but it slopes sharply
and is deep enough for swimming over at the other
edge. Watch the water and, as it grows darker, you
will see the stars come out. Just above the reflection
of that tallest pine tree will be the big stars of
the Lion, and the curve of the Sickle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The twilight fell as they sat there talking until,
it seemed to Betsey almost by magic, there was the
bright star twinkling in the water just as Miss
Miranda had said, with other pinpoints of light that
grew gradually clearer to show the golden Sickle
and the white blur of the Milky Way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is strange how I always loved to watch them,”
Miss Miranda said, peering into the quiet water as
intently as Betsey; “I used to see all the Signs of
the Zodiac, that I believed from their name were so
mysterious, but that were pictured here so plainly,
month by month, that they became as simple as
every day. Michael believes that good or ill fortune
all goes by luck or charms; some people think
that it depends only on what star is the ascendant.
He always maintained, after the house was burned,
that it was because, when we set out on the journey
that left it all alone, we none of us touched both sides
of the gatepost as we went through the last time.
And it was at the time when the group of stars called
the Crab, the most unlucky constellation of them all,
was shining in the pool. But I know it was only a
bolt of lightning and a wooden roof and nobody at
hand to save the place. It was burned to the ground
almost before the neighbors saw the smoke and
flames among the trees.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But don’t you want to rebuild it? Don’t you
love it? Don’t you want to live here again?” Betsey
asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miranda did not answer. It was evident
that Elizabeth had put questions that she had no
right to ask, so she pursued the matter no farther.
The rising breeze had begun to stir the water once
more, so that the stars rocked and twinkled and
turned into long streaks of glimmering light. Dick
had fluttered across the grass, mounted the broken
house wall and now sat there in the dusk, cawing
loudly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He must see something there behind the wall,”
observed Elizabeth. “Oh, what is that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>For Dick, bent on some marauding errand, had
swooped down out of their sight, with a harsh cry
that was answered immediately by the voice of some
unseen person within the house. The blackened
door burst open and there came through, first Dick,
flying pell mell, then a dark figure outlined for a moment
in the doorway. The brighter western sky
showed beyond the roofless house, throwing the bent
head and broad shoulders into sharp relief. The
breeze, driving through the open door, swept forth
a flutter of papers, the loose pages of a battered
book, that spread far and wide across the grass.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I beg your pardon,” said a voice, “I didn’t
know any one was here, I thought it was only that
mischievous Dick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The speaker came forward. It was David Warren.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I come up here to read in the evenings sometimes,”
he explained in some embarrassment. “It
is so quiet and cool, and the sunset light lasts late
here on the hill. There is a bit of ceiling left at
the corner inside the wall that makes a dry place to
keep some books. But I hadn’t meant to be trespassing.
I had laid my pocketknife on a stone and
Dick’s eye caught it at once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He began to gather up the scattered papers which
were drifting more and more wildly across the lawn.
Betsey ran to give assistance while Miss Miranda
assured him that he was not trespassing and was
welcome to what hospitality the desolate house afforded.
As for Dick he perched on a branch overhead,
rocking back and forth apparently with mirth
over the mischief he had wrought. He swelled his
feathers and gave voice to his one great accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good morning,” he said in his rasping, squeaking
voice, “good morning, good morning!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the only thing he had learned to say, and
he never made the effort except at moments when he
was completely satisfied with himself and all the
world.</p>

<p class='c007'>They sat, all three, beside the pool for a little
until the water was sprinkled thick with dancing
lights. David was asking many eager questions in
regard to Mr. Reynolds’ machine. Had there been
any more accidents? Were the new experiments
turning out well? Did Mr. Reynolds feel encouraged?
There were many other queries besides,
about gas turbines and lubricating systems, too technical
for even Miss Miranda to be able to answer.
They both walked home with Elizabeth through the
warm dark and left her at her door. She had not
much to say, for something was puzzling her
greatly. In gathering up the scattered papers she
had found one among the rest that looked strangely
and disagreeably familiar. The light was dim but
she could not mistake the drawing, that intricate and
much-hated figure, the frustum of a pyramid. She
could not conceive why David Warren should be
troubling his head with such matters. Indeed, there
seemed to be a good many things that she could not
understand at all.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div>AS THE CROW FLIES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Michael was trimming the grape vines,
ably assisted by Dick, who sidled along
the trellis, keeping up a fluent stream of
inarticulate advice and trying, apparently, to get his
horny toes or his long black bill cut off by the snapping
shears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, get along with you,” cried Michael at last,
stung to impatience by having cut off the wrong twig
in his effort to avoid injuring the inquisitive bird.
“Go on about your business and leave me be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He gave his black companion a friendly cuff that
pushed him off the trellis and launched him into
flight. Dick swooped across the garden, where Betsey
stood laughing at him and at Michael’s irritation,
and flew to the top of the stone wall where he
sat scolding with all his might.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is not wise to do that,” commented Miss
Miranda. “When he caws so loudly he is apt to
bring the wild crows and they do not like him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Friendly as Dick was with all members of the
human race, he was plainly not on good terms with
his own kind. Luxurious living had made him
larger and sleeker than they, but a less agile flier.
He led a lazy life and was not so practiced or swift on
the wing as those hard, wiry birds who gained their
living by gleaning in the fields. Even as Betsey
watched, a rusty, wild crow flew up, attracted by his
cawing, and perched on the wall beside him, followed
by another and another.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, look,” Betsey cried, “they are pecking him.
And here come some others!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The wild crows had fallen on poor Dick with
vicious, stabbing bills and were being joined by a
rapidly increasing crowd of comrades. The clamor
that arose was deafening, Dick’s pathetic caws being
mixed with the angry, harsh cries of his assailants,
all of whom were jealous, it seemed, of his plump
sides and shining coat. He took flight finally and
sailed away toward the top of the hill, pursued by a
trailing cloud of chattering enemies.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The wild crows have always hated him,” Miss
Miranda said anxiously, “and he will never learn
not to provoke them. There are so many this time
that I am afraid they will peck him to death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elizabeth set off in pursuit, hoping to find where
they had alighted and to drive off the attacking birds,
but, although she ran with all speed across the lawn
and through the gate in the wall, she lost sight of
the flock over the crest of the hill. The continued
uproar, however, of angry crow voices guided her
onward so that she followed farther and farther,
hoping every moment to come close enough to scatter
the struggling group with a stone. She found
traces of the battle here and there, in scattered
black feathers that drifted over the grass. She
would not give up the chase so long as poor Dick,
driven ever farther from home, still called for help
from his human friends with a voice that grew continually
weaker.</p>

<p class='c007'>Past the ruined house she ran, and down the farther
slope of the hill, through unexplored country
where thick hedges and overgrown flower beds
showed the traces of an abandoned formal garden.
There was a sundial, so covered with vines that no
one, even at high noon, could have read the hour
on its mossy face, and a tumbledown arbor smothered
in climbing yellow roses. More and more she
realized what a beautiful place this must have been
where Miss Miranda had once lived, but Dick’s unhappy
progress gave her little time for observation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Over the lower wall swept the chase and over the
wall went Betsey in pursuit, clambering up one side
by the aid of a leaning pear tree and half sliding,
half tumbling down on the other. She reached
the ground with rather of a thud, but she picked
herself up and ran on, paying no attention to the
jarring fall. The way went across plowed fields
now, and through bramble hedges, past a stream or
two and even into a swampy meadow where the
green sod sank under Elizabeth’s footsteps and left
muddy pools that sucked at her shoes. Finally a
farmer’s cottage at the edge of a river came in sight
and, to her relief here, the running fight seemed to
have come to an end. She saw the wild crows perching
and rocking on the boughs of a big tree before
the gate, cawing in such shrill-voiced anger that she
was certain they must have been somehow robbed of
their prey. As she came panting into the farmyard
she observed there was a pigeonhouse high up
under the peak of the barn roof and it was plain,
from the way in which the astonished white birds
were bursting out of doors and windows, that it was
in their dwelling that the harassed and desperate
Dick had taken refuge.</p>

<p class='c007'>A surprised farmer, not knowing quite what to
make of such a breathless and disheveled stranger,
led her up the narrow stairs that climbed to the
pigeon loft and opened the door upon the rows of
perches and nests. Dick came fluttering to her at
once, a weary and bedraggled bird, with his bright
plumage torn and his head bleeding and plucked almost
bare. She held him carefully as she picked her
way down the steep stairs again, unable to help
laughing at his croaking attempts to tell just what
had happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>The farmer’s wife, a hearty, friendly woman, insisted
that Elizabeth sit down in the shade of the
big tree and rest a little.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will bring you a drink of water; just wait a
minute until I draw some fresh from the well,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c007'>She went bustling away, leaving Betsey very glad
to sit there quietly and regain her breath. It was
a pleasant place, with the grassy slope before the
house going down to the river, crossed, just here, by
a little bridge. She sat watching the smooth water
with its swinging lily pads and the quaint stone arch
of the old bridge, thinking what a peaceful and picturesque
spot it was.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It looks almost like one of Aunt Susan’s picture
post cards,” she reflected, “only I don’t think Aunt
Susan would stop long at any such quiet and out-of-the-way
place as this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There had been a gay-colored shower of bright
postals from Aunt Susan lately, ships and hotels and
panoramas of tropical scenes where the inhabitants
seemed to have nothing to do but sit about on
banks of flowers with brilliant green palms as a
background. There were also bits of scenes like
this one, places of historic association, chosen, Betsey
knew, not because her aunt had spent much time
viewing such spots, but because that type of post-card
gave more space for correspondence. Aunt
Susan never wrote letters. Each one of her pictured
messages, however, ended with the words,
“You ought to be with me.” But they had ceased
to arouse any longings in Betsey’s heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>The farmer’s wife presently returned with a glass
of milk, some fresh rolls she had just taken from the
oven, and honey from the row of blue beehives that
stood at the foot of the garden.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Joe tells me that you said the bird belongs to
Miss Miranda Reynolds,” she said, seating herself
ponderously at the other end of the bench while
Elizabeth partook of the welcome refreshment, and
scattered crumbs for Dick. “I suppose it must
have belonged to Mr. Ted Reynolds before he went
away. He was a great boy for pets always. I will
never forget how he brought home a young alligator
and let it get lost in the house so that the laundress
finally found it at the bottom of her washtub of
clothes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, did you know them?” cried Elizabeth.
“Did you know Miss Miranda’s brother and her
cousin and that big house on the hill?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was housemaid there for seven years before
I was married,” responded the woman. “It was
Miss Miranda herself arranged the flowers for my
wedding and gave me my wedding clothes. A dear
beautiful place it was, that house. I would never
have come away from it except to marry Joe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She smoothed her white apron over her knees and
went on in eager reminiscence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can remember every inch of it and am always
telling the children about what I saw there. One
thing I can’t forget was a big desk with glass doors
and such strange ornaments on the shelves. There
was a little pine tree carved out of something that
looked like green glass. I used to stop and stare
at it every time I dusted. Did they save that, do
you know, when the place was burned?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” Betsey replied to the other’s evident relief,
“the toy-cupboard is safe at the cottage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have always been waiting to hear that they
were going to rebuild the house,” the woman went
on, “but year after year goes by and they keep on
living in the little cottage. Miss Miranda loved
her home so, I know she is sick at heart to go back
to it. I don’t understand it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor do I,” observed Betsey with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It may be because of that work her father is doing,”
suggested the other shrewdly. “Such things
do take a power of money and I am certain Miss
Miranda would do without anything rather than
have him give it up. She would think that was her
share of the success that she has always felt certain
was coming. He has worked at the thing ten years
now, he should be finishing it one of these days.”
She dropped her voice to question Betsey with the
earnestness of real friendship and devotion. “I
don’t see her very often now, but I think of her all
the time. Do you—do you think she is happy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey shook her head slowly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid not,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Her father was always so anxious that she
should be, he was absorbed in his work but he never
would forget about that. He depended on her and
consulted with her even when she was not a great
deal bigger than you, yet was running the whole
place and keeping the two boys in order. Mr. Ted
adored her and she him, he was a fine fellow. But
that Cousin Donald, we in the kitchen could never
abide him with his sharp selfish face and his overbearing
ways. She could face him down, but at
heart she was afraid of him, I used to think. He
could say such cruel, cutting things to hurt her, although
she would never show it. I have known
Mr. Ted to black his eye for him, for all he was so
much younger, when he thought his sister had been
made unhappy. Proud they are, and sensitive to the
quick, father and daughter and son. That Donald
Reynolds was an alien amongst them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her flood of recollection went on, but began to
wander to such details as Joe’s courting and how they
were married, in which Betsey did not feel quite so
great an interest, so that at last she took advantage
of a slight pause in the talk to say that she must go.
There was one more question she wished to ask.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That cousin, what did he look like?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, insignificant like,” was the somewhat vague
answer. “He had black hair and eyes that were
greenish, a little, they always put me in mind of
boiled gooseberries. He was the sort of person
bound to prosper, and after Miss Miranda helped
to bring him up I wonder how he can see her want
for anything. There now, if you must go I have a
setting of eggs I’ve wanted to send over to her for
her poultry yard, they’re the best in the state.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She brought Betsey the package, rather apologetic
that it should prove larger than she had intended.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I just tucked some duck eggs into the box, too.
This is an uncommon breed that Joe got me, and
splendid for market. I’m sorry it’s such a big bundle
and the way home so long. I do wish the horses
weren’t all in the field or Joe could take you home in
the cart. You tell Miss Reynolds that those are
with Clara Bassett’s love and that she will never forget
her. I will be over to see her myself, first chance
I get.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her kind hostess stood watching her from the
gate as Elizabeth set off homeward. She had been
directed to take the path along the river bank and
then turn into a cart track that went over the hill and
she had been warned that it was “quite a ways.”
She discovered herself to be more tired after her
long chase than she had thought, and beginning to
feel a few aches due to her jarring tumble over the
wall. She tramped steadily onward, nevertheless,
Dick riding on her shoulder and the bundle of eggs
tucked under her arm. It was of awkward shape
and size, and would slip no matter how she held it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The path along the river did not seem to be taking
her in the direction of home and it was discouragingly
rough and stony. She sat down to rest,
with her feet dangling over the bank above the
water and began to think over what she had been
hearing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Everybody who knows Miss Miranda seems to
want to make her happy,” she reflected, “and the
strange thing is that nobody can!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She sat for some time listening to the cool splashing
water slip away below her feet, then with a sigh
got up to go onward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I’d better take a short cut across the
fields,” she decided. “It won’t be half so far and
I’m sure I can find the way. If only I don’t drop
the eggs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The flight of a crow is supposed to be a direct
route, but not the way of a crow pursued by a flock
of his jealous kin. The chase that Dick had led her
had been so crooked and confused that it was difficult
indeed to find which was the shortest way home.
She pushed through hedges, hurried down by-paths,
stumbled into tangles of wild blackberry vines, but
was not at all sure that she was making any real
progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>The round wooded hills and squares of well-kept
field and meadow all looked much alike to her. A
big house among the trees, showing tall stacks of
brick chimneys and a tiled roof was, moreover, so
completely unfamiliar that she became still more
perplexed. The afternoon was coming to an end,
she grew wearier and wearier and the box in her
arms seemed continually heavier and more awkward.
At last she stood still, having completely lost her
bearings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Dick,” she said forlornly, “can’t you show
me the way home?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick, however, quite unabashed by the trouble he
had caused, flew from her shoulder and began
gravely hopping about the grass at the side of the
way. Betsey looked about her desperately and saw
a half-plowed field at some distance, bordered by
a hedge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There may be some one at work there,” she
thought, “and I can ask the way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But it seemed far indeed to drag her heavy feet
up the hill, through a spur of woodland and along a
rough lane between two hedges. She could hear
the soft trampling of a horse’s hoofs on the loose
earth and a cheerful whistling that told her that
some sort of help must be at hand. Scrambling up
the bank, she found a gap in the bushes, thrust her
head through and began—</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you please, will you tell me—oh!”</p>

<p class='c007'>For the horse standing in the furrow, just unharnessed
from the plow, was the big white Dobbin
and the plowman was David Warren.</p>

<p class='c007'>He came pushing through the hedge at once and,
before a word was said, took the heavy parcel from
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You and Dick seem to be rather far from
home,” he observed cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be careful, it’s eggs!” she warned as he thrust
the bundle under his arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dobbin and I were just going home,” he said.
“Wait until I can drive him around by the gate and
he’ll be proud to carry you. He’s not much of a
saddle horse. His back is more like a seat in a
Pullman car.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was quite right, for weary Betsey, once perched
on the wide back, thought it the most luxurious spot
on earth. The gentle old horse seemed entirely
willing and, even when Dick came fluttering up to
perch on one of the brass knobs of the heavy harness,
he merely looked around with an expression of mild
wonder to see what new sort of rider this might be.
While they moved slowly up the lane, Elizabeth
gave an account of the crow’s misadventures.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dick, you old rascal, if you ever give so much
trouble again I will wring your neck,” the boy said
severely, whereat the black bird cocked his eye and
seemed to chuckle silently over the manifest untruth
of such a threat.</p>

<p class='c007'>There followed a little pause in their talk as they
moved onward up the slope with Dobbin’s great feet
rustling in the high weeds and his long shadow slipping
so quietly ahead of them across the grass.
The dropping sunlight was falling on David’s uncovered
head and turning it from red-brown to coppery
gold. They reached the crest of the slope
where an opening in the trees afforded a wide view
of that same stretch of valley across which Betsey
had sat gazing that day she was caught by the shower
before her first visit to Miss Miranda. Here,
without a word of bidding the big horse came to a
stop. David laughed, and laid an affectionate hand
on his neck.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dobbin always knows where I like to stand and
look over the valley,” he said. “We stop here so
often that now he never goes by. I like to look
at those college towers and wonder how I can go
there some day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, are you going there?” cried Betsey with
an excited wriggle that nearly unseated her; “so am
I—if nothing happens.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She thought of the geometrical and historical difficulties
in the way and sighed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A great deal will have to happen before I get
there,” David remarked light-heartedly, “but I
mean to manage it somehow. Perhaps only Dobbin
knows how much I think about it while I work
here in my uncle’s fields.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is that your uncle’s house?” questioned Betsey,
looking up at the big chimneys above the trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and all this land is his, up to Somerset
Lane. He is away a great deal and expects me
rather to keep an eye on things, but of course I work
on the farm too. There is really almost no one else
to do it with all the labor crowding into the cities.
I try to study by myself at night but—I don’t get
very far. There are some places where I think I
will stick forever.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh,” exclaimed Betsey, suddenly seeing the explanation
of that puzzling page that had fallen into
her hands the night David’s papers blew away, “do
you find it hard to prove what is the volume of the
frustum of a pyramid?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do I?” returned David from the bottom of
his heart. His freckled face crinkled into a delighted
grin as he looked up at her. “Don’t tell
me that there is some one else who finds it as mysterious
as I do! ‘The frustum of a pyramid is
equal to three other pyramids,’ I can get that far
and I can even understand the first one, but the second
is almost too much for me, and the third is quite
impossible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I,” returned Betsey gravely, “if I can once
get the first one, I can go on to the end. It is just
at the beginning that I always come to grief.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you could help me and I could help
you,” David suggested excitedly. “I would sleep
easier at night if I could once get those three pyramids
into my head. I have my book in that corner
up at the ruined house. I believe we have time to
look it up before you must go home. Come up,
Dobbin!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The willing old horse strode forward again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s not just geometry that bothers me,” Elizabeth
confessed. “We had some questions in history
to-day and it frightened me to have them show
how little I knew. We were asked who were the
Barbary pirates and what was the greatest time of
America’s merchant marine. Those are just the
things I never can remember.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“History doesn’t seem so hard,” returned David,
“except that, if you study it without a teacher, you
get so interested in some parts that you forget to
pay any attention to the others. You say that they
asked you about the merchant marine and America’s
ships? Now I never thought of paying any attention
to that. Hurry, Dobbin. I begin to think
that we have no time to lose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They turned into Somerset Lane, hastened up the
final slope and left the white horse tied to the cottage
gate. Miss Miranda seemed to be still at
work in the garden, so they deposited Dick and the
package of eggs in the kitchen and went scurrying
across the lawn to the  gate in the wall. If they
were to vanquish their common enemy before dark
it was necessary to make some speed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The key of the gate stood in the lock, but was stiff
and rusty and creaked as David forced its turning.
They hurried along the grassy path, stooping under
the low-hanging branches and brushing aside the
unpruned shrubs. For some reason they trod more
quietly and spoke more softly when they came within
the circle of the open lawn. It seemed very breathless
and silent in the late afternoon sunlight, this
beautiful place with its black, motionless pine trees, its
gleaming pool and its empty, ruined house open to
the sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish I understood about all this,” said Betsey,
almost under her breath as they stood a moment by
the still pool, “why the house was never rebuilt,
why Miss Miranda works so hard and looks so worried
and so sad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s something strange about the place,”
David agreed, “and Miss Miranda and her father
are not like other people. Sometimes she seems to
me like a person who sees a great trouble coming
nearer and nearer and doesn’t know what to do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish,” Betsey said with a deep wistful sigh,
“oh, how I wish we could help her!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps we can,” returned David. He was
looking about him intently, as though already deciding
what could be done.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think,” Betsey went on, “that nothing could
please me more in the world than to see Miss Miranda
lose that worried, frightened look, and to
know that she is comfortable and happy again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>David shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want more than that,” he declared. “I’m
not going to be satisfied until everything is as it was,
until this house is rebuilt and they are living here
again, safe and peaceful and at home. If we are
to help at all, we should work for that. Shall we
try?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The ambition seemed to be rather an overwhelming
one. To Elizabeth, as she looked about the
still garden, sleeping in the level sunshine, it appeared
that only something miraculous could awake
it into stirring life again. But how much happiness
it would bring! She often wondered what that
strained look in Miss Miranda’s eyes could mean;
she understood now, it was the look of some one
who wants to go home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” she answered bravely, “we will try.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a great undertaking and they shook hands
upon it. They did not look very large, those two,
under the shadow of the tall pines and of the vast,
broken walls, as they stood beside the pool. They
seemed, indeed, to be pledging themselves to the following
of an impossible purpose. Yet, as Betsey’s
firm vigorous hand met David’s hard brown one,
suddenly it became a plan that might come true.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chapVI' class='c004'>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div>THE BARBARY PIRATES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Although there was not much more
than an hour of daylight left, the two
friends put off their mathematical researches
and spent a little time in exploring the
ruins of the house. David opened the heavy,
charred door of his own refuge and showed Betsey
the remains of the room inside with the fragments
of a brick staircase that had once wound upward
above it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This end of the house was not destroyed at once,
I think,” he said, “and I believe a good deal of the
furniture was got out of it, things that you can still
see at the cottage. The roof fell after a day or
two and carried the walls with it, so that there are
some relics left in the ruins still. This little room
under the stairs must have been a den belonging to
Miss Miranda’s brother Ted, for I found a pair of
spurs and a rusty rifle, a melted silver cup, and some
such things here. Beyond must have been the library
and a conservatory behind, at least there are
mountains of broken glass beside that wall.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From here, then, had been rescued the toy-cupboard
and such pieces of heavy mahogany furniture
as were still in use in the cottage and which stood
out in such strong contrast to the very plain chairs
and tables of painted pine that filled the rest of the
Reynolds’ abode. The ivy that had once climbed
the high walls, that had crept around the leaded
windows and festooned the pillared doorway, now
spread its mats of green and its slim, rose colored
tendrils over the desolate ruins and covered what it
could. Broken pictures still showed half buried
under bricks and plaster, while a mirror leaned
crookedly against a wall, showing fantastic patterns
of shivered glass.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This must have been the kitchen,” David went
on as they progressed farther. “Be careful how
you climb about, these old walls are none too solid.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He himself, however, went clambering up heedless
of precaution, his only thought being, apparently,
that harm might come to Betsey.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That place beyond I’ve never explored,” he
said; “wait here a minute until I get to the top of
that ridge of bricks. The weight of both of us
might make it begin to slide.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t,” she objected, “it doesn’t look safe at
all. Can’t you go to the other—”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had left her protests unheeded and had
clambered half way up the slope of broken débris,
when she saw it begin to tremble under his feet, then
suddenly give way and carry him down out of her
sight. She ran to the edge to see, squeezed through
the cleft made by the collapse of the brick-heap and
slid down after, to find David, a trifle scratched and
with his red hair full of brick-dust, standing gazing
about him with untroubled interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This must have been the end of the house where
the fire started,” he commented. “See how much
blacker the walls are and how even the bricks are
burned. And look, that must be a part of one of
the chimneys still left standing: you can see that the
lightning struck it and split it to the very base. I
wonder, with all the frost and rain since the fire,
that it hasn’t fallen long ago. I don’t quite understand
what this room is. It seems to have been
away from the house and on a lower level.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elizabeth balanced on the edge of a stone and
looked at the confusion about her, where rusty heaps
of metal and coils of wire lay amid the other rubbish.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must have been Mr. Reynolds’ workshop,”
she suggested, “and see, even those steel bars are
melted together. The fire must surely have been
hottest just here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe you’re right.” David was picking his
way about looking at the broken engine parts and
the melted bits of steel. “I suppose he was working
even then on that same invention. I think it
ought to be a very great thing when it is done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think,” began Betsey, “that—oh, look,
look!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She stood transfixed with dismay, staring at something
behind him. David gave one glance and
knew better than to pause and look again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quick,” he cried, and, seizing her hand, dragged
her, almost headlong, across the open space and up
another slope of sliding bricks.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old chimney, split by the lightning and weakened
by fire and frost, was ready to tumble at the
slightest shock and had received its final impetus
from the collapse of the neighboring wall. As Betsey
looked at it the whole mass was tottering and,
but for David’s quickness, would have engulfed them
both. As it was they were nearly smothered by the
cloud of dust and crumbled mortar. Blinded and
breathless, they scrambled out of the hollow to
safety. David’s dusty face had not lost its cheerful
smile, but he spoke with great decision.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was very wrong to let you go in there,” he
said. “I might have seen that the whole place
is shaky and that the walls have been collapsing, little
by little, for years. We will not go near this
end of it at least, again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elizabeth knelt by the pool to wash the dust from
her face and hands, while David, having done the
same, went to fetch his geometry book.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” he said, sitting down by her with something
of a sigh, “we really must, I suppose, begin
on that tiresome pyramid.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They had a gay session there under the trees before
the light began to fail, while each, by instructing
the other, succeeded in mastering all former difficulties.
In the end they fell to firing rapid questions
at each other, Betsey trying to trip David in
his fluent statement of the theorem, he in turn lying
in wait for her on obscure points of the proof, until
neither could be shaken from the thoroughness with
which knowledge was now entrenched.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How lucky it is,” said Betsey, putting down the
book and leaning back with her elbow on the rim
of the pool, “that each of us stuck in a different
place! I hope it will often be that way and that
we can help each other more. Now why—” her
method of finding things out was apt to be by blunt
questioning, a habit she could not easily put aside,
“why are you getting ready for college all alone
when it is so much easier to do it by going to
school?”</p>

<p class='c007'>David stretched his long legs in the grass and
looked fixedly down into the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was nearly ready to go two years ago,” he explained,
“but I left school instead and began to
work, since I was too young to go to war. I have
no father and things were not going very well with
my mother and me while the war lasted, and besides
every pair of hands was needed for the extra labor.
Now that peace has come, our affairs are better again
and I could go to college next autumn, except that
there are some things I still have to learn. I took
this place with my uncle because I knew the work
would only last through the summer and then would
leave me free. I have a cousin who is a professor
over at the college and who helps me with my work,
but I don’t have time to go to him often.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elizabeth was thinking, as she sat looking into
the water, of how she would feel if further education
became suddenly as complicated for her as it
was for him. The knowledge of his difficulties
tended to arouse her own flagging zeal, so that she
began to feel that obstinate pyramids and elusive
pirates could not really stand in the way of true determination.
As she sat reflecting, footsteps approached
along the grassy path and Miss Miranda’s
voice sounded behind them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been looking for you everywhere,” she
said. “Dick has been trying to tell me about his
adventures, but has only succeeded in convincing me
that it was a very desperate affair. Poor battered
bird, he will not sit on the wall and call out challenges
to other crows soon again. I have invited
myself to have supper with you here beside the pool,
while you tell me all that has happened.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She set down the basket that she had been carrying
and began to spread a table cloth on the grass.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Michael is feeding Dobbin,” she said, “and I
have telephoned to Betsey’s house, so that all that
you have to do is to sit down and eat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The suggestion was adopted with alacrity, for
the appetites of the two were keen, and their own
evening meals seemed far away. Amid much mirth
was told the tale of poor Dick’s misfortunes, of his
headlong flight from his enemies and of the amazement
of the pigeons on whose hospitality he had so
unceremoniously thrust himself. Of her talk with
the farmer’s wife, Betsey did not say so much, only
delivered her messages and accounted for the eggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought I would drop them a hundred times,”
she said at the end. “I never knew that eggs could
grow so heavy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She sat lazily on the grass, feeling rested and content,
unmindful for any further exertion than to
dabble her fingers in the quiet pool. A shimmering
band of sunset light dyed the opposite half of the
basin as though the water had been set on fire. Miss
Miranda, leaning comfortably against a tree, had
taken out her knitting.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is something wrong with Michael to-night,”
she observed as she clicked the needles in
and out. “He is sitting on the bench by the gate
staring straight before him and not even smoking
his pipe. When I asked him what was the matter
he only growled out that a black cat ran across his
path last night and that trouble was bound to follow.
I suppose he is reciting spells to himself, to drive off
the evil. Certainly there was no use in talking to
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elizabeth was looking up at the ruined house,
trying to imagine how it had seemed, with lights in
the windows, with fires on its deserted hearthstones,
with all the warm brightness of home shining
through its open doorway. Miss Miranda must
have been thinking, with far greater and more painful
clearness, of much the same thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I used to believe,” she said suddenly in midst
of a silence, “when I came home from school and
crossed the lawn to that side door, that burned,
marred door in the wall that is the only one left, that
it opened on the dearest place in the world. The
big, black cherry tree that grows beside it used to
spread such a cloud of white blossoms every spring!
I always thought, when I heard people talk of the
narrow gate of Heaven, that it must look just like
my little dark door under the blooming cherry
tree.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She moved over to sit by Elizabeth at the edge
of the pool.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not easy to come home to an empty, silent
house that is not really home,” she went on. “No
one knows that better than I, my dear, or would like
more to make it up to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey moved closer and smiled up at her gratefully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do make it up to me,” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>David, who was lying stretched out at Miss Miranda’s
feet was busy at a task of his own. It
seemed that he was a persistent boy who would never
lay aside a piece of work until every detail that he
could think of had been added to make it complete.
He had fetched some clay from the far end of the
garden and was modeling the frustum of a pyramid
and those three confusing portions into which it could
be divided. Betsey watched him idly, quite content
that he should have the labor and she the benefit.
He demonstrated them with a flourish on the smooth
rim of the pool.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You make it so clear,” remarked Miranda,
“that I almost understand it myself, although I had
forgotten it ten years ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your father must know all about such things,”
David said rather wistfully; “it discourages me to
think of how much he knows. Do you suppose he
would care to have—to have any one help him in
his shop, just to sharpen tools and screw bolts and
run errands?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He needs some one like that very greatly,” Miss
Miranda answered. “As a rule he likes to do his
work alone for fear the news of what he is trying
to make will get about before he is ready. But
I know you well enough to be certain that you will
give away no secrets.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elizabeth drew her dripping hand from the water
and took up one of the pyramids.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never thought I could understand it so clearly,”
she said, “and now if I could only remember about
the Barbary pirates and the merchant marine, I
really could be almost sure of going to college.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Barbary pirates?” repeated Miss Miranda.
“I happen to know something of them, myself.
How do they come to trouble you when they have
all been dead so long?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I just don’t seem to be able to remember
when they lived, or what they did,” Betsey sighed.
“They seem to come in that dull middle period in
the history, between the Revolution and the Civil
War, when nothing particular ever seemed to happen
and most of the Presidents were men whose
names you never heard before. It’s all very difficult.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you remember,” returned Miss Miranda,
“that little green tree that you saw in my toy cupboard,
the first day that you came? It was put there
by my great-grandfather, who fought against those
self-same pirates and helped to put an end to their
wrongdoing. If I should tell you how he came into
possession of the tree, I believe you could remember
better what happened in those early days and how
America built up her shipping, that merchant marine
about which I have heard you groan. Would you
like to hear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We would,” answered the two in a single
breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And may I go and bring the tree to show
David?” Elizabeth asked. She scarcely waited for
permission but was off down the path having quite
forgotten her former weariness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Michael was sitting on the bench as Miss Miranda
had said, and would not even respond to her greeting
as she passed. He had been so friendly of recent
days that she stopped, surprised, and turned back
to question him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the matter Michael? Is it really the
black cat that troubles you so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Matter enough,” he returned morosely, “even
without the black cat. There has been trouble brewing
for long and I am thinking it is about to break.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But why? What trouble? What makes you
think so?” Betsey pressed her questions anxiously.
But his answers were most unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, just trouble. And how do I know it is
coming soon? I feel it in my bones like.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He would say no more and she was forced to go
about her errand. As she crossed the lawn by the
house she saw that the workshop door was open to
the warm night air and that Mr. Reynolds was as
busy as ever inside. It made a quaint picture, the
shadowy room, the brilliant circle of light, the old
man’s intent, intelligent face bent over his work,
the black crow sitting immovable as a statue on the
corner of the table. A pleasant noise of quietly
whirring wheels came out of the door, a peaceful,
comfortable song that mingled with the cheery
chirp of a cricket in the grass. It was
such a happy, untroubled scene. No presentiment
of evil could be lurking that night in any bones, but
Michael’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Elizabeth returned with the little tree,
David was as entranced with it as she had been. It
stood on the edge of the basin in the last of the
failing twilight and, in its airy grace of form and
glittering of jade and jewels, it seemed scarcely a
thing of reality at all. Miss Miranda laid her knitting
on her knee for the light was gone at last. The
sunset colors had faded in the water and the fireflies
were beginning to wink and shine in the shadows of
the pine trunks as she began.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div>THE TREE OF JADE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>From the time when they first went to the
dame school to learn their letters, Jonathan
Adams and Humphrey Reynolds spent most
of their waking hours in each other’s company.
They looked for birds’ nests together in the woods
at the edge of the broad Susquehanna River, they
paddled along its marshy banks, they played absorbing
games in that busy, entrancing place, Jonathan’s
father’s shipyard. Or they would stand side by
side watching a great ship of war come sailing up the
bay, a flying vision of square white sails and darkly
outlined rigging, the vessel that was commanded by
Captain Reynolds, Humphrey’s father. The two
boys talked much of what they would do when they
were men; they would sit for long hours on the
wharf, their legs dangling above the water, discussing
the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going into the Navy like my father,”
Humphrey would say, “and I intend to sail in the
finest and fastest ship of the whole fleet to the very
ends of the world and back again. And I will have
you for executive officer, Jonathan.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” Jonathan would return seriously, “I get
sick when I go to sea and I don’t like hardtack and
salt pork. No, I will stop at home in my father’s
yards and some day I will build a ship that is a real
ship and not just tubs like these.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They parted when they were seventeen and did
not meet again for years, for Humphrey went into
the Navy as he had planned and Jonathan, with mallet
and chisel in hand and with that sober, earnest
air that always clung to him, was already at work
in his father’s shipyard. In time he became master
of the entire business, while Humphrey was scouring
the seas, sailing on just those far voyages of which
he had so often dreamed. Jonathan had his
dreams also, but he did not speak of them, only
toiled away at building the heavy, sturdy vessels
that carried America’s trade overseas early in the
last century. Honest ships they were and reliable,
as sure of coming to port as though they had belonged
to the age of steam, but oh, how long it took
them to make a voyage! In the privacy of his dingy
little office Jonathan, with the door fastened, would
push aside the clutter of plans and drawings and
would get out the model of a strange vessel, sharp,
slender and graceful, with a hull like a racing yacht.
He would set it upon the bench to carve a little here,
to alter a curve by a hair’s breadth there, or merely
to stand staring at it sometimes for hours at a time,
staring and thinking.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day when he was so standing, utterly lost in
some unspoken vision, there came a knock at the
door, followed by an impatient second one and a
thunderous third, all during the moment of time that
it took the shipmaster to put out of sight his beloved
model. When the door was opened there
strode in a tall sunburned person in blue uniform,
Humphrey Reynolds come at last to see his old
comrade, bringing a roll of government documents
under his arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Congress has taken a sudden turn toward increasing
the Navy,” the young officer explained,
“and the orders are going out to build twelve ships
in haste. One of the contracts is to come to you,
if you will take it. They are even in such need that
they have not laid down the specifications to the last
bolt and rope’s end, so that the man who builds this
ship and the officer who superintends the construction,
can really have something to say about the design.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked his old friend very steadily in the eye
and saw a slow smile of deep, unspoken delight
dawn upon the shipbuilder’s face. Jonathan
Adams’ hard hands did not often tremble, but they
shook a little now as he reached up to the shelf
above the bench and brought down his model.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been thinking about such a design since
I was ten years old,” he said, “and the chance to
build it has come at last. We will make them a real
ship, Humphrey, and the whole world will open its
eyes when it sees you sail her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She grew up quickly on the ways, that ship of their
very hearts’ desire, with her bowsprit standing far
out over the neighboring street, and with people
stopping in the lane to watch Jonathan’s whole force
of workmen toiling up and down her timbered sides.
Old Navy officers who had seen, some of them, the
ships of the Revolution, and who had all fought in
the War of Eighteen-twelve, would come to inspect
her and would shake their heads.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look at that high, sharp bow,” one would say;
“such a craft will never be seaworthy in the world.
Why can’t these young fellows stick to the models
we have tried out for them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And see the spread of sail this drawing shows,”
another would comment, pointing fiercely with a
stubby forefinger; “why, the whole ridiculous affair
will capsize in the first good puff of wind! I’m
thankful I don’t have to go to sea in her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the two comrades closed their ears and sat,
often far into the night, in the cramped little office,
poring over drawings and comparing designs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have her thought out to the last ring, block
and halyard,” Humphrey would say, “and you never
even knew if you could build her. What a dreamer
you are!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It takes dreaming to keep a man at his work,”
Jonathan would answer. “How do you think I
would have had the patience, all these years, to drive
wooden pins into cross-timbers, or to mend the rigging
of limping coastwise schooners if I had not
been thinking of just such a ship as this, and seen
her, in my mind’s eye, putting to sea under full sail,
to smash every sailing record that has been known?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The day of the launching came, then the stepping
of the giant masts, the completing of the rigging and
the bending of the new sails.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The <i>West Wind</i> will be ready for sea in two
weeks now,” Humphrey said, one morning at breakfast
to Miranda Reynolds—she was my great-grandmother
and I was named for her. They had
been married only a month and this would be his
first cruise since their wedding. She drew her
breath quickly, she had not known it was to be so
soon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“People say,” she began hesitatingly, “old sailors
and longshoremen and even the Naval officers that
have been here, say that the <i>West Wind</i> will never
stand a storm.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are the kind of men,” Humphrey scoffed,
“who would be sailing vessels of the model of the
Ark, did not people like Jonathan Adams have the
courage, sometimes, to build something new. No,
the <i>West Wind</i> is going to teach all the shipmasters
something they never knew before, when once she
sets sail. And we expect to clear for Gibraltar in
less than a month. Why, Miranda, you’re not crying?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” declared Miranda, choking bravely, for
tears have no place in a sea captain’s household.
She even managed to muster a watery smile. “I
wonder what you will leave behind you in foreign
parts this time, your gold snuffbox, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a longstanding joke that young Captain
Reynolds was so careless of his possessions that he
never came home from a voyage without having lost
or mislaid by the way everything he had. But the
gold snuffbox had survived several cruises, since it
was the most valuable thing he owned. It had been
presented to him by the citizens of his town when
he had come home from sea some years ago, after,
so he expressed, “a miserable Algerine pirate lay
alongside him and insisted on being taken.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is probably only a short paragraph in your history
book and possibly a very dull one that tells you
how, a little more than a hundred years ago, the seas
swarmed with pirates whose home ports were the
North African cities of Algiers, Tripoli and Tunis.
The great nations of Europe and, with them, the
young United States, used to buy safety from these
lawless Barbary States by sending them gifts and
tribute. But when, finally, the Pasha of Tripoli
sent word to our President that his last gift was
not large enough and that more must be sent, the
answer was a fleet of American warships and the
bombardment of the astonished monarch’s seaports.
There were many spirited encounters during that
little war, many feats of daring seamanship of
which history has lost sight among the greater events
that have followed. But for years after the struggle
was over, the United States Navy still policed
that foreign sea with such thoroughness that the
pirate craft that dared venture from port were bold
and desperate indeed.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was thither that the <i>West Wind</i> was to sail,
with dispatches for the Commodore of the Mediterranean
Fleet. At last the ship was ready, a rare
and beautiful sight with her slim hull, her rows of
guns and her towering reach of silvery new canvas.</p>

<p class='c007'>She sailed with the early tide, at daybreak of a
mid-April morning, a ghostly fairy-like thing, slipping
away in the gray light and the mist of dawn.
Miranda stood on the dock to watch her go, with
Jonathan beside her staring fixedly after his winged
dream, flying at last beyond the seas.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There will be tales to tell when she comes back,”
he said at last, “and I look for her to cut down the
sailing time by three, four, five days, perhaps. She
has borne away the hearts of both of us but she
is a good ship and she will bring them back again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His stout faith in his ship was matched only by
Humphrey’s unwavering confidence. Others might
have said that this maiden voyage of his first command
was a heart-breaking one, for many of his
men were untrained seamen, grumbling at their narrow
quarters and heavy labor, while the art of
handling the new vessel was, in itself, not easy to
acquire. The weather was boisterous and the winds
fitful, but the <i>West Wind</i> did not betray the two
good friends who had brought her into being. The
storms lent her wings so that, at last, anxiety and
discontent gave way entirely to pride in the speed
that she was making. There was a certain grizzled
old sailor, however, who openly discredited all
claims of the ship’s prowess, and who even refused
to believe the evidence of the day’s reckoning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Twenty-three days is the best she will do,” he
vowed over and over again. “I will stake a year’s
pay on it that she can’t make an hour less.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet, on the nineteenth day of their passage, a
warm, gusty afternoon of early May, when the far
horizon swam in haze, it was he who came himself
to the captain and broke through all etiquette to report,
round-eyed with amazement—</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s land been sighted, sir, and I don’t understand
it at all. It—it looks like Gibraltar!”</p>

<p class='c007'>So she came through the gates of the Mediterranean,
a gentle breeze behind her, “sails all filled
and asleep” as the seamen said, a swift slender hull
under a cloud of snowy canvas. She pushed into
the straits where had plied back and forth the daring
Phœnician craft, the Roman galleys and the
high-pooped ships of Venice and of Spain, but she
was no lesser vessel than any one of them, for she
was the first of the Yankee clipper ships!</p>

<p class='c007'>I have never seen those North African cities,
Tangier and Tunis and the rest, and I have no doubt
that to-day they are very little like what Humphrey
Reynolds saw. But his stories have come down to
me so clear and vivid, that I almost feel that I have
known those very places with their white houses,
their tropical green, the confusion and chatter of
foreign tongues in the narrow streets, the hushed
silence of the wide, walled gardens. For long
months the American warships would lie off these
ports, keeping a watchful eye upon the doings of the
dusky potentates and arch-pirates who ruled them.
The officers and men would go ashore to stare at
the strange sights and to bargain for souvenirs
among the street vendors, seemingly oblivious of the
scowling, hostile faces about them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was in Tripoli on a day when Captain
Reynolds was walking from one dark cupboard
of a shop to another, looking for some fitting
gift to take home to Miranda, that he
was suddenly startled by the sight of a pale
face among all those dusky ones. It was not
white, but yellow, and belonged to an old Chinaman,
as dried up and withered as a mummy, who
had somehow wandered, a rare thing in those days,
to this African city and kept a little shop there
among the Moors, Arabs and Berbers of Tripoli.
His wares were different from the others and very
new indeed to Humphrey’s eyes, for just such carvings
and silks did not often find their way to America.
The old man invited the officer to come inside where
more articles stood upon the narrow shelves and
where Humphrey had almost decided upon the purchase
of a beautifully carved ivory box for Miranda
when he spied, in a niche opposite the tiny window,
such a thing as he had never seen before.</p>

<p class='c007'>A little pine tree was growing in a pot, a real,
living one, and a miniature of just such a tree, bent
and twisted by the sea winds, that grew upon the
hill above the Susquehanna at home. The art of
stunting and pruning these tiny trees, developed in
Japan perhaps, but known to some Chinese, was
quite unheard of in the Western world so that Humphrey
could scarcely believe his eyes when they told
him it was green and growing and evidently kin to
the giant ones in America.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miranda must have that,” was his instant decision;
“she will find that I can manage to bring
home the gold snuffbox and something more besides.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His determined effort to buy the tree, however,
had a strange effect. At the first the old shopkeeper
merely met all his offers with a determined shake of
the head, but, as Humphrey insisted, he became more
and more excited and at last, wringing his hands,
burst into a torrent of jabbering explanation. Captain
Reynolds had cruised along these shores long
enough to have learned a little of the mixed dialect
of French, Spanish and Moorish words by which
foreigners and natives contrived to understand one
another, so that he was able to gather from the
Chinaman’s flood of talk that the pine tree was the
most precious of his possessions, that he had carried
it himself all the way from Pekin, that it was a
hundred years old and that he felt certain the spirits
of his ancestors loved to cluster about its twisted
little branches. What had caused his banishment
from his own land Humphrey could not make out,
but he did gain some inkling of how the withered old
man felt as he looked back upon some frail, small
hut on the shore of one of China’s muddy yellow
rivers, upon some bit of land that he and his ancestors
had tilled patiently for unnumbered generations,
upon a tiny garden where the tree had grown.
No, it was quite plain that he would not sell it!</p>

<p class='c007'>So the ivory box was bought for Miranda after
all. As Humphrey prepared to go, a picturesque
person came into the shop, a fat, black man, very
richly dressed with the silk scarfs, satin cloak and
gold embroidered garments of a high court official.
The young American glanced at him curiously as he
squeezed by in the semi-darkness of the narrow place
and was conscious of the penetrating stare of two
hard black eyes that he could almost feel boring
into his back as he went out. Before he had gone
far, he thought that he heard a queer, smothered
cry of terror in the shop. But the street was so
full of noises that, though he paused to listen, he
could not be certain and so went on again. In the
busy days on board ship that followed, the Chinaman
and his treasure presently passed completely
from his mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reports of the <i>West Wind’s</i> quick passage had
been going about, all this time, through the Mediterranean
Fleet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But that was only a trial,” Humphrey kept saying,
“when we were learning how to handle her.
On the voyage home we’ll show you even more
plainly what she can do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That voyage was now soon to be, for the vessel
had been selected to carry back the Commodore’s
dispatches and reports to Washington. On the day
before she was to sail, a message came from the
Pasha of Tripoli that he was sending his personal
representative to make the ship a visit of ceremonious
farewell. Captain Reynolds sighed deeply
when he heard this news, for such overtures from a
government elaborately friendly but secretly treacherous,
were uneasy occasions. When the stout,
dusky minister of state came over the side, gorgeous
in his jewels and satins, Humphrey, after a moment
of doubt, recognized him as the man whom he had
met in the old Chinaman’s shop. The other gave
no sign of recognition, however, but gravely went
through the elaborate messages from his august master,
inspected the ship with solemn interest and expressed
not only surprise, but some doubts when told
of the time she had made between America and Gibraltar.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, it cannot be done!” he cried. Not even
pirate craft, it seemed, could fly on such swift wings.
“There are favorable winds and chances for good
luck on the eastern passage, but when your prow is
turned toward home again, when you are obliged to
go southward to get the trade winds that blow for
all ships alike, then you will find that this is an ordinary
craft, just like all the rest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will equal our record or better it,”
Humphrey replied obstinately, “although, as I own,
the westward voyage is a longer and more difficult
one. But the <i>West Wind</i>, sir, is a ship not like
other ships.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After they had sat some time in the Captain’s
cabin, partaking of refreshment and exchanging polite
assurances of good will, the black visitor, with
great ceremony, produced an impressive gift from
his master, a richly embroidered scarf which he presented
with a long speech that Humphrey only half
understood. He accepted it unwillingly and made
such reply as he could, after which there came an
awkward pause in the talk. Finally the Tripolitan
minister, with smooth boldness, remarked that his
illustrious master would be willing to accept in return
some small gift, merely as a remembrance of
the visit of Captain Reynolds and his beautiful ship.
For a moment Humphrey was utterly at a loss, since
the Government that had filled his magazines with
powder and shot in case of trouble had quite neglected
to provide for any such occasion as this. Yet
the beady eyes of the African, fixed so steadily upon
him, seemed to hint that some present must be forthcoming
or serious difficulties would follow. There
seemed but one thing to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How Miranda will laugh at me, after all,”
Humphrey sighed as he slowly brought out the gold
snuffbox and placed it in the dark hand that was
extended so quickly to receive it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The exchange of gifts should have brought the
visit to an end, but for some reason it did not. The
African still sat, staring across the table at Humphrey,
his eyes narrowed to black slits.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The gift is of great beauty,” he said at last,
“but I might explain that the Pasha, my master, has
especial love for his gardens and is most particularly
delighted when he is given any—any small
curiosity to add to the treasures he has already gathered
there.” Seeing Humphrey look blank, he explained
more clearly. “You and I met, some days
since, in the shop of that mad old Chinaman who
owns, but will not sell, that little pine tree, a hundred
years old. The Pasha had taken a fancy to
own it, so, since the old man would not part with it
willingly, he sent some servants to—to fetch it.
But they failed. I understand the tree is on board
this ship after all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“On board the <i>West Wind</i>?” echoed Humphrey
amazed. “I give you my word that it is not
here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The tree is on this ship,” insisted the other
steadily. “The Chinaman heard somehow of our
coming and departed, treasure and all; he was seen
fleeing through the town; he was seen making his
way to this vessel. And the Pasha of Tripoli desires
the little pine tree!”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a pause, but Humphrey said nothing.
The dusky visitor shrugged his shoulders and slipped
one sleek hand within his satin robe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The American Captain wishes further persuasion,”
he said with a sly grin. “I have something
here for himself alone, which will perhaps make
him more generous.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He drew out a handful of gold coins and laid
them upon the table, looked at Humphrey narrowly
and, seeing no signs of yielding, sighed deeply and
drew out another and another. He piled them up
in little shining heaps and stood gazing, with an
expectant smile across at the American. But, since
Humphrey did not put out a hand to take them he
broke forth petulantly—</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the name of the Prophet, is not that enough?
You grasping Yankees would have everything!
These are not African coins, man, but good English
sovereigns, French louis d’or, Spanish doubloons
such as you can spend like water anywhere you go.
And all in exchange for one small thing upon which
my master has set his heart. Come, you drive a
hard bargain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I drive no bargain for what does not belong to
me, to be paid for in stolen coin,” Humphrey answered
hotly. “Do you think that I do not know
that your pirate vessels have brought in this gold;
that, for each of those heaps of coin, there has
probably been a good ship sent to the bottom, English,
French or Spanish? Have you not learned
once what America thinks of piracy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fat man shrugged his shoulders again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“America is a forgetful land, and far away,” he
commented drily. “News carries thither slowly and
judgment comes even slower back again. It is
twenty years since your country fought with mine;
we believe America is ceasing to watch us. The
Atlantic is a broad and windy sea!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do not know,” the young officer replied
slowly, “that there is a wise man in my country, my
comrade and dear friend, who has learned how to
make the Atlantic a thousand miles less broad. He
built this ship with which we have shortened the
voyage by four days and will, when we set sail again,
lessen it by more than that. Your pirate craft are
swift but Yankee wits are swifter and presently your
vessels will bring back a tale—for every sea-coast
will ring with it—that Jonathan Adams’ ship the
<i>West Wind</i> has crossed the ocean in eighteen days.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eighteen days,” scoffed the other, “that is past
any man’s belief. Ships move by sails, not wings!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eighteen days,” repeated Humphrey sternly,
“I promise you that you will hear of our voyage
made in just that time. And when other vessels are
built to match or to better her, our country will come
a great stride nearer to you, a thousand miles nearer
to traitors, murderers and thieves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He brought his hand down upon the table with
such force that the heaps of gold went rolling and
tumbling to the floor, and the dignified Arab was
forced to go groveling on his hands and knees to
pick them up again. When he arose, Humphrey
was standing by the door which he held open.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will send an officer,” he said, “to go with you
to search the ship. Since you believe that no man
speaks the truth, you shall see with your own eyes
that the Chinaman and his treasure are not
here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no doubt that the man who had the
duty of escorting the foreigner over the ship took
extreme delight in conducting him through the narrowest,
dirtiest recesses of the hold, so that the
court official’s fat person was breathless and his
silken garments much the worse for grease and tar
when he finally expressed himself as satisfied and
came once more on deck. His farewells were less
stately than his greetings had been, and he turned
back for a last word before he went over the side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the <i>West Wind</i> sails away, after all, carrying
my master’s heart’s desire, may every curse and
every evil spirit known to good Mohammedans, follow
you upon your way. May every hardship that
sailors can suffer, fall upon you, may your voyage
be such a one as never captain knew before!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He departed in a great show of dignity and magnificence
and was rowed ashore, while Humphrey,
with a sigh of relief, turned himself to the preparations
for getting under way. He had vowed a
vow within himself that Jonathan Adams should not
be disappointed and that, on the homeward voyage,
they would shorten the passage by the five days for
which he had hoped.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was at daylight next morning, when the <i>West
Wind</i> had cleared the harbor of Tripoli and, leaving
behind the palm-clad shore with its minarets and
towers and its evil, hostile city, was standing out to
sea, that Captain Reynolds sat down in his cabin to
examine the log book which he had sent for, to make
certain that wind and weather and the exact hour
of weighing anchor had been correctly noted. He
smiled as he glanced at the entry of the day before
with its record of the visit of state.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he had the impudence, even, to curse me,”
he reflected, chuckling, “as though any one could
hide on my ship without my knowing—”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped abruptly, the page half-turned in his
hand. For a strange sound was developing in the
locker opposite his bunk, a scratching as though a
rat were shut in behind the door, then the clicking
of the latch as, out from the narrow space where no
one would think a grown man could hide, came
tumbling the Chinaman, half-smothered, but clutching
unharmed his heart’s treasure in its porcelain pot.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mohammedan’s curse had been thorough
and, so it began to seem as the voyage went on, of
some effect, but he had forgotten one thing. Whatever
went wrong, whatever accident, small or great,
befell the ship on her race across the Atlantic, the
wind never failed. The very sprites, afreets and
genie known to Arab fancy seemed to sit in the hollow
of the sail and lend strength with their blowing
to the lusty trade winds. Lines parted, tackle
jammed, and sails carried away, but still the wind
held. The oldest but ablest seaman, he who had
not believed in Gibraltar when he saw it, fell from
a yard and was picked up with a broken knee. A
falling block, dropping from a height to the deck
below, crushed, in its passage, the shoulder of another
sailor. But still the wind held and still the ship
cut the South-Atlantic rollers like an arrow. Seven
days, eight days, nine days—they were halfway
across, and excitement had begun to run breathlessly
high.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of the ninth day, while the <i>West Wind</i>
was wallowing in a cross sea, it was discovered that
the water casks had broken loose from their lashings,
that two of them were crushed, others injured,
and that the greater portion of their precious
water had leaked away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then we have need to make port all the more
quickly,” Captain Reynolds said grimly, and stood
by in person while, to each man including himself,
the meager allowance for each day was measured
out.</p>

<p class='c007'>The one who fared worst upon the voyage was
the old Chinaman. He suffered hideously from sea-sickness
for the first few days, although he made
shift to stagger on deck, to haul at ropes and to give
such service as his feeble strength allowed. When
the water failed, he seemed, somehow, to be suffering
far more than any of the rest. On the second
day after the mishap to the casks, he came to the
captain’s cabin, utterly refusing to be driven away.
With trembling yellow hands he drew the pine tree
from beneath his rags and set it on the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After I die,” he requested calmly, “will you not
in justice see that my share of water still goes to
keeping my ancestors’ tree alive?”</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed that his whole allowance of drinking
water had been poured into the pot, since he preferred
to perish himself rather than permit his great
treasure to droop and wither.</p>

<p class='c007'>Humphrey argued and commanded, but to no purpose.
The Chinaman merely shook his head obstinately
and vowed by all his gods that he would
not drink while his tree was thirsty. At last, however,
a compromise was made. The little pine was
to remain on the Captain’s table and every day, in
Humphrey’s presence, the Chinaman was to drink
half his allowance of water and pour the other half
upon the dry roots.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you can keep alive on that, your tree should
also,” Humphrey said; “there is no other way to
do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Still muttering protests that his tree would die,
the old man crawled away. Humphrey stood looking
silently at the little pine tree, so fresh and vigorous
in spite of its hundred years. He took the water
that had been set upon his table and drank half of
it at one gulp, for he had just come below and
the hot quarterdeck was a thirsty place. Then he
paused a moment, the half-empty cup in his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am a soft-hearted fool,” he muttered and
poured what was left on the dry earth of the porcelain
pot.</p>

<p class='c007'>The days passed while the men grew weaker and
more sluggish at their work, but still the breeze held
and the speed of the <i>West Wind</i> did not falter.
They passed no ship from which they could obtain
water, their only hope lay in the making of port.
They turned northward, lost the trade winds, seemed
for a terrible moment to be hanging becalmed, but a
stiff breeze caught them and bore them still toward
home. The old Chinaman seemed to shrivel away
like a dead leaf, but he came stumbling every day to
share his mouthful of water with his precious tree.
Captain Reynolds himself looked more worn and
haggard than did any of his men. Only the Chinaman,
glancing sideways with his slanting, beady eyes
at the lusty green of the little pine, seemed to suspect
why. They were like the flitting ghosts of a
ship’s crew that morning when the hot, glittering expanse
of sea was broken by a wavering line on the
horizon and the lookout’s husky call of “Land-ho”
announced the low green shore of Maryland.
Eighteen days from Gibraltar and all records broken
at last!</p>

<p class='c007'>She came into the Susquehanna River for repairs,
did the worn but triumphant <i>West Wind</i>, and Jonathan
Adams came rowing out to board her, his sober
face for once all wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By five days you shortened the voyage,” he said,
“and I had not really hoped for more than four.
I always said she was not a tub, but a real ship at
last. There will be others like her, and her children’s
children will dare to spread such sail that they
will cross the Atlantic in half your time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As Humphrey came up the ladder to where
Miranda was waiting on the wharf, his first words
were—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I left the snuffbox behind,” while she, laughing
shakily, answered—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I knew you would.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole crew, down to the cabin boy, were
hailed as heroes when they left the ship, but there
was one who managed somehow to go ashore as
mysteriously as he had come aboard. The old
Chinaman with his treasured pine tree disappeared,
no one knew whither, hiding himself, perhaps, lest
some emissary from Africa should even yet seek him
out and rob him. For more than a month Humphrey
searched and inquired for him all up and down
the shore of the bay, but no one had seen him and
no one knew where he had gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jonathan Adams’ ship the <i>West Wind</i> sailed on
many voyages and was the model for other vessels
of her class, bigger and swifter even than herself—the
great race of American clippers that once ruled
the seas. They gave our country the highest place
in the world’s shipping, and they brought her, even
as Humphrey had said, a thousand miles nearer to
her neighbors across the Atlantic. But that is
not all of the story of this famous voyage. The
real end came seven years later, when Humphrey
had risen to be Commodore Reynolds and when,
between two cruises, he was spending a holiday at
home. One summer afternoon, a small, bent figure
toiled up the driveway of the big house above the
Susquehanna. Humphrey, with Miranda, was sitting
in the shade of the high-columned veranda and
for a moment did not recognize the strange face, so
covered with dust that the yellow skin and slanting
eyes were scarcely visible. But the old Chinaman
walked straight to Miranda and laid his offering on
her lap.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For you,” he said. “He wanted to bring it to
you from the very first!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not the real pine tree, but the one that
you see here, made of jade and enamel with tiny
jewels set around the top of the pot. Humphrey
and his wife exclaimed and admired and examined it
on every side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I do not understand,” Humphrey kept saying.
“How did you come to make it, and to bring
it to us after seven years?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“After seven years!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old Chinaman smiled patiently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You Americans are ever in such haste. How
long, think you, it takes a true craftsman to carve a
tree of jade?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Betsey and David were frankly gossiping,
but with the most intent and serious purpose
in the world. The days were growing
so long that they could do their studying out of
doors in the evenings, and the place of their choosing,
where they struggled with dates and angles and
difficult lines of Virgil, was the stretch of grass
around the pool. When the first stars began to
show in the water, it was a signal for discussion of
lessons to be put aside. Later they would walk back
to the cottage, where Betsey would help Miss Miranda
in the kitchen or would stroll with her in the
garden while David would go into the workshop,
take off his coat, arm himself with an oil can in one
hand and a wrench in the other and would say to
Mr. Reynolds, who usually did not even hear him
come in—</p>

<p class='c007'>“All ready, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To-night they were delaying a little, after having
mastered the subject of extreme and mean ratio, and
were piecing together such bits of knowledge as each
one had concerning their friends in the white cottage,
trying to come to some conclusion as to what
was the matter and what could be done. Michael’s
doleful face seemed to give warning every day that
the “feeling in his bones” was in no way diminished,
and Miss Miranda appeared more and more concerned
and weary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Miranda only meant to help us remember
the Barbary pirates,” David was saying, “but she
told us more than that. I begin to see how it is their
blood, hers and her father’s, to dream of progress
and new things. That new engine that Mr. Reynolds
is trying to develop may turn out as great a
thing as the clipper ship, and may bring as many
changes. And she is doing as much for it as her
father, managing that he is never disturbed or troubled
or discouraged. Even if he should want to give
it up, I think she wouldn’t let him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is more like Jonathan Adams than like
Humphrey Reynolds,” rejoined Elizabeth, “though
they were both her great-grandfathers. Jonathan’s
daughter married Humphrey’s son and they inherited
the shipyard, so she told me yesterday, and built
clipper ships after him. Some of them really did
sail to Europe in nine days, just as Jonathan had
hoped. They made a great fortune during that time
when American ships were trading with the whole
world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And it was that fortune that built this house,”
David took up the thread of speculation, “and gave
Mr. Reynolds his scientific education and sent him
to all sorts of places abroad to study. But where
is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wherever it has gone,” Betsey said, “it may
come back again some day. I will always like to
think of how Jonathan and Humphrey succeeded in
the face of everything. I think Mr. Reynolds will
succeed in the same way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Miranda will never lose courage,” David
observed reflectively, “but her father is—a little
different. He is old and tired and he is trying to
do the work of a young man, of a person with
strength and confidence in himself. Without Miss
Miranda he might have lost spirit long ago, but she
will help him to the very end. She is anxious and
lonely, she wants her brother, and she wants her
house. But more than anything she wants her father’s
success.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They must have been very happy when they
lived here,” Betsey went on, “with Mr. Reynolds
busy at his work, with Ted coming home for vacations—he
was only just out of college, Michael
says, when the war began—with that Cousin Donald
gone into business and doing well. Mr. Reynolds
must have given him the money for a start and
I think they must all have felt more comfortable
when he was gone. And then the house burned and
the war came, and everything was changed so that
nobody was happy any more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Reynolds is happy,” David insisted; “whatever
is wrong is being kept from him. To work at
something you love that is coming nearer and nearer
to success, that is one of the best things there is.
But Miss Miranda isn’t happy! And she is growing
more unhappy every day. It’s time something
was done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If her brother could only come home,” Betsey
suggested.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He might come home to-morrow, he might be
kept a year,” replied David. “No, we can’t wait
for him. We will have to do something ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what can we do?” questioned Betsey
blankly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know yet,” confessed David, knitting his
eyebrows in earnest thought as he sat on the grass
with his arms about his knees, “but there is bound
to be something we can do if we just stand by and
try hard enough. And I would try anything for
Miss Miranda!”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was nothing small or mean about David’s
ambitions nor in the loyalty of his friendship.</p>

<p class='c007'>“While we are talking it all over, there is one
other thing I should like to speak about,” began
Betsey hesitatingly. “Do you ever think that there
is anything about this house—this place that was a
house—that is at all—queer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>David sat bolt upright and stared at her fixedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have been talking to Michael,” he accused
her. “Michael says that ill luck is brooding over
the whole place like a summer thunderstorm and
that there is no telling where the bolt will strike. I
never saw a person who could believe such strange
things as Michael.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” Betsey maintained stoutly, “it is not from
anything he said. It is only what I have seen myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She sat looking at him, first with sharp penetration,
then with the dawn of a sudden discovery.
She was possessed of less soaring ambition than David,
but of a more keenly observant eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have seen something yourself,” she announced.
“You are trying to argue me out of it
because you don’t want to believe your own eyes.
Tell me what you have seen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>David was silent for a minute, apparently struggling
obstinately against his own convictions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was just—lights, and—and something moving,”
he confessed shamefacedly at last. “It might
have been almost anything, wind, fireflies, moonlight
on that broken mirror. I’m not going to let Michael
make me believe in goblins.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is only lately that I have seen it,” Betsey
said. “From the house where I live you can see
the top of this hill and I am certain that, on three
nights at least, I have seen a light moving back and
forth among the ruins. It is very small and dim and
it goes so slowly, sometimes I think it has disappeared
entirely but it always comes in sight again.
One night it was raining and the next the moon was
shining and the next it was dim starlight, but the
light was there. And you have seen it too?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” admitted David, “though I have tried
to make myself believe it was a mistake. I was
coming up Somerset Lane after dark, the first time,
and I saw that same light, bobbing and jerking
across the broken walls. I stopped and watched
and tried to persuade myself that it was fireflies or
glow-worms, but I didn’t succeed. A very small
light, as you say, and moving slowly but never really
coming to rest. I—I don’t quite like it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was growing dusky in the shadow of the pines,
so that Betsey began to look about her with a slight
uneasiness. The subject was one that did not tend
greatly toward making one peaceful or at rest in
that lonely place.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I rather believe Miss Miranda will be looking
for us,” she said somewhat lamely at last. David
laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t feel very comfortable here myself,” he
agreed, “and it is getting rather dark. Yes, it
must be time to go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They went along the path together to the gate
without speaking, until, with his hand on the lock,
David paused and looked back.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going back after it grows really dark,” he
said, “to see what that thing is. It ought not to
go on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no,” cried Elizabeth in real horror. “Oh,
no!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is something that ought to be cleared up,”
David insisted steadily. “If we don’t do it ourselves,
we should tell some one who will. The place
belongs to Miss Miranda and it should be looked
after. Yes, I am going to see about it to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then,” replied Elizabeth with a long and rather
gasping breath, “if you will go, I am going with
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They did not work very long at their respective
tasks that evening. Betsey was an absent-minded
helper as she put away the dishes and David, it appeared
later, had dropped so many tools and needed
to be told so many things twice over, that even Mr.
Reynolds had grasped vaguely that something was
not quite right and had stopped to gaze at him over
his spectacles, in mild and pained astonishment. It
was earlier than usual and just at the edge of real
darkness, the soft, black dark of a warm spring night
before the moon has risen, when David presented
himself at the kitchen door for the ostensible purpose
of taking Elizabeth home. With rather trembling
hands she took off her apron and put away her
towels, and prepared to go with him. But their
plan was not to be carried out so easily, or without
any hitch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will walk down the hill with you,” announced
Miss Miranda with somewhat disconcerting suddenness.
“I have some things to take to Mrs. Donovan
at the foot of the lane. I promised her some
of my cabbage plants.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will take them,” chorused the two conspirators,
speaking together with such promptness
that any one less preoccupied than Miss Miranda
might have guessed that some project was on foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I must see her myself,” she persisted and
set out with them, to their ill-concealed dismay.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not very late and we can come back after
she has left us,” David found opportunity to say before
Miss Miranda joined them with the cabbage
plants.</p>

<p class='c007'>They went down the hill without much of their
usual talking and laughter, for Miss Miranda appeared
absorbed in her own thoughts, and her two
companions, perhaps a little appalled by their undertaking,
seemed to have not much to say. They
bade her good-night at Mrs. Donovan’s door with
suspicious alacrity and, having seen it safely closed,
turned once more up the lane. By David’s advice
they were to pass the cottage, climb higher up the
hill and find the spot where the boundary wall was
nearest the ruins of the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If we wait by the pool,” he explained, “we
might not see anything. It might not come near,
whatever It is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey shivered a little. She was ashamed of
the thrills that were running through her and the
tendency of her teeth to chatter unless she kept
them firmly closed.</p>

<p class='c007'>They walked briskly, but some one who came behind
them was walking quicker still. A man passed
them as they trudged upward, a man quite indistinguishable
in the dark, save for the faint white of
his collar and of his face. Betsey could make out
that he was a broad person, not very tall, with an
alert, though rather heavy step. They lagged a
little after he had passed, to let him get well ahead
of them so that they could go on with the discussion
of their plans unheard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Usually it’s not very late when the light comes,”
David said. “I don’t believe we will have very
long to wait.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of his haste, the man who had passed
them must have lingered a moment at the Reynolds’
gate, for he was only just opening it and going up
the walk as they came by. The light from the cottage
windows fell upon him as he approached the
door and showed his figure more clearly although
his face was still hidden. Betsey looked at him
curiously but David seemed too much occupied to
give him more than a passing glance. They left the
lane, skirted the wall and came finally to the place
they sought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” directed David, “here is a broken tree
leaning against the wall. Up you go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a little assistance and not much scrambling,
she clambered to the top of the wall. They were
at the back of the house here, with the nearest line
of blackened ruin not a hundred feet away. A
spreading willow grew so close to the wall that its
feathery boughs brushed Elizabeth’s hair and passed
smooth fingers across her cheek. The stones were
warm under their hands, from the past day’s sun,
their heads were among the leaves and birds’ nests,
very high, it seemed, above the ground. The whole
desolate place before them was very still.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The moon will be up presently,” David whispered,
“so I think It will come soon, while it is still
dark.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey trembled a little in the warm night air, but
said nothing. The minutes passed, then a half hour,
finally the hour itself struck from a spire in the village.
The strokes sounded very thin and far away
as the night wind carried them. A faint cow bell
jingled in a distant field, a comfortable, friendly
sound that Elizabeth missed when it moved and died
away. They began to relax their tense muscles as
the time passed slowly, to swing their feet and to
talk almost above their breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It may not be coming to-night,” said David,
“we will not wait much longer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That man at the Reynolds’ gate, I wonder what
he wanted,” observed Betsey. “It was rather late
for just ordinary visitors. Did you notice him,
David?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When the light fell on him I thought I had seen
him before,” he answered. “Yet after all it was
no one I knew, just a man I saw in the village this
morning by the post office.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elizabeth was not greatly heeding, for the round,
golden rim of the moon was showing almost opposite
them, above the jagged heaps of ruins. Slowly
it rose, spreading more light through the trees, until
it was half above the horizon and shone, an orange
semicircle, there above the old house. She was
about to speak when David touched her elbow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look beyond that pine tree,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little glow-worm light was visible at last.
It was, at first, half hidden by the bushes, but it
moved slowly along, swinging near the ground, hesitating,
almost coming to a standstill, but still always
making some progress. It moved along the ruined
walls, it came nearer and nearer. To both of them
it became evident that whatever it was, whatever
carried it, must presently pass opposite them and be
darkly outlined against the glowing background of
the moon. They had only to wait and they would
see.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wait, however, began to seem very long, since
the wavering advance of the point of light was very
slow. Betsey, in the lagging delay as the seconds
passed, felt her attention beginning to wander. She
noticed how slim and graceful were the sweeping
boughs of the tree that hid them, she observed the
thin frettings of black and white of the shadows of
the leaves on the wall. Very earnestly she wished
that she could sit as still as David could and not be
tempted to swing her feet against the stones. She
began to think, as the minutes still dragged, of that
man they had seen go in at Miss Miranda’s gate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“David,” she leaned over to whisper, “you said
you had seen that man before. What did he look
like?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why,” David answered, coming out of his own
thoughts with a start, “he was dark, rather heavy,
but with a thin face. I didn’t like him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did he have,” a slow possibility was dawning
in Betsey’s mind, as she dwelt upon who this man
might be, why he had come, and as she recollected
a chance phrase spoken by the farmer’s wife beside
the river, “did he have a sharp, selfish face?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, I think so.” David spoke so very slowly
that she could have shaken him for his deliberation.
“Yes, I rather think he did. He had scowling
black eyebrows and eyes very close together. Yes,
I would put it just that way myself, a sharp, selfish
face.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That was the way Mrs. Bassett had put it, and
Michael also. Elizabeth swung her feet over to
the other side of the wall, the weird, moving light
quite forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going back,” she said. “It must be that
cousin, Donald Reynolds. I do believe he was waiting
in the lane for Miss Miranda to go out, so that
he could find her father alone. And she has always
dreaded his coming. Oh, why didn’t we think who
it was before!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—but—” stammered David, quite dazed.</p>

<p class='c007'>One more minute and that hidden figure would
move across the moon, but she had no thought for
that mystery now. She jumped down outside the
wall and ran, ran with all breathless speed, stumbling
in the thick grass and over jutting roots and stones
until she came out at last into the moonlit lane.
Her heart was thumping against her side and Miss
Miranda’s gate looked very far. She sped down the
hill with no further thought of what she and David
had gone out to find; it was no time to be spying on
goblins when this much-dreaded and very real person
was so near.</p>

<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div>THE SUBSTANCE OF A DREAM</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Scarcely even for a passing glance did
Elizabeth pause at the front door of the cottage
although it stood open, as Miss Miranda
had left it, with the lamp still burning cheerfully on
her sewing table inside. Weary and breathless, she
stumbled along the path, turned the corner of the
house, and saw the brightly lighted workshop with
its door also standing open to the warmth of the
night. It was as she thought, the stranger was
here, sitting on the high stool beside the table, talking
volubly, thrusting forward his long-chinned, dark
face and pounding on his knee to give emphasis to
what he said. Mr. Reynolds sat opposite in the
one arm chair the place afforded, looking white and
frail and old in contrast to his visitor, very quiet,
and listening with earnest attention. Like an image
of carved ebony, Dick sat immovable on one of the
posts of the back of the chair. The green-shaded
light, with its brilliant, narrow circle of illumination,
showed nothing else clearly, but gave only
faint vision of wheels and pulleys, of shining glints
that sparkled back from polished steel or ruddy
copper, while through the whole room droned the
slow song of turning wheels.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a step on the flagstones behind Elizabeth
just before she mounted the doorstep. As she
had hoped, David had followed her. Both men
glanced up as the boy and girl entered, but there was
no pause in the talk, since any new presence seemed
to make no impression on the tenseness of the scene.
Even Dick scarcely turned his head as he sat like
some brooding spirit above his master.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t you stop those infernal wheels?” Donald
Reynolds said, as they came in. “I cannot hear my
own voice with them grinding away in my ears.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“David!” said the older man in tone of request.</p>

<p class='c007'>With quick obedience, David stepped to the end
of the room, pulled a lever, jerked a protesting,
crackling switch and brought the whirring song to
an end. Without the familiar sound the place
seemed uncannily silent as Donald went on talking.
To the presence of David and Betsey he gave no
heed, having apparently but one thought, to speak
the words he had come to say before Miss Miranda
should return.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So I made up my mind that you should be told
what a great wrong you are doing Miranda,” he resumed.
“For ten years you have spent time and
money on this worthless piece of work, pottering
and tinkering and pretending that you really hoped
to accomplish something in the end.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I have accomplished something,” returned
the old man gravely. “I am very near to success
now and ten years is not long when you remember
that I lost all my records and all my models when
the house was burned. No, ten years has not been
too much to spend.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not time alone that you have spent, but
money, spent it like water when it should have been
making Miranda comfortable. Have you stopped,
ever, to think of how she works and saves and
pinches, how she toils in that garden and fattens
miserable fowls for the market so that you can go
on with this game of yours?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miranda chose to have it so,” Mr. Reynolds returned
quietly, but the two onlookers could see him
wince.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you known Miranda longer than any of
us and have not yet learned that she would give the
breath out of her body to make other people happy?
Would she complain or choose otherwise if she
thought your desire was set upon this one thing,
this machine that you call a life work, but that any
one else would call a pleasant fad, a plaything that
would never succeed?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If my recollection is correct,” Mr. Reynolds
said, “she used to make some sacrifices for you,
when you lived with us, that you might be happy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His chance shot seemed to strike at some more
vivid memory than he knew. The other was silent
for a minute, but then burst forth again, more
sharply and bitterly than before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is that any reason why I should stand by now,
and see her robbed and cheated as you are cheating
her? You are willing to spend your life following
a dream, but you have no right to spend hers. You
say that she is willing, but do you really know it?
Do you notice how worn and tired and anxious she
begins to look?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elizabeth would have broken in upon him, checking
his words with a wild tumult of indignant protest,
but David laid a hand upon her arm. This
was a matter for their elders alone, his look seemed
to say, and must not be interrupted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose, Donald,” Mr. Reynolds was beginning
gently, “suppose this affair were to turn out
less of a dream than you think? We have followed
dreams before, we and our forbears in this family,
and they have led to success and—what appeals to
you far more—to fortune. Miranda is, I know,
looking worn and troubled; I think it is her home
that she is grieving for. It is my belief that in a
very little time she may have it back again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“People like you are always hopeful,” returned
Donald, “always declaring that with a little more
time and a great deal more money, success will come.
Can you not stop deceiving yourself, can you not
give up and admit that you have failed? You have
a handful of screws and wires and a few turning
wheels here—” he waved his hand to include the
whole workshop in the scorn of a person who knows
nothing of mechanics—“but what do they signify?
What do they count for compared to ten years of
your life, or of Miranda’s?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He leaned his elbows on the table, brought his
face closer yet to his unhappy uncle’s and spoke with
even fiercer accusation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You say that you will be able to give back to
Miranda the house she loves, when all that you have
ever done is to destroy it for her. Have you ever
looked over the ruins, as I have, noticed that the
blaze was hottest at the south end, and hottest of all
where your workshop stood? That was where the
fire began, there can be no doubt of it. Miranda
says it was lightning that set the house on fire,
but—” he lowered his voice—“I know better. A
spark from one of your wires, a blaze in some oily
packing, that is what brought about the tragedy.
You mechanical geniuses are too much in the clouds
to safeguard those you pretend to love. The burning
of the house was due to your own heedlessness!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no, Donald,” cried the old man, driven out
of his calmness at last, and with his voice betraying
cruel pain. “I can’t—I won’t believe that it was
my doing!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may be certain that it was,” returned the
other without mercy, “and I think, in your inmost
heart, you have long suspected that it was so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey was no longer to be silenced, not even by
David’s insistent pressure on her arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s not true,” she burst out. “We saw ourselves
where the lightning struck, that began the fire.
The chimney was split from top to bottom.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes?” assented Donald, turning to her and
speaking in a tone of hard, cold quiet. “You can
prove that, I suppose? You can show the marks
to my uncle here? Real evidence would comfort
him greatly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No—no,” she faltered in reply. “We were
exploring in the ruins and some of the walls fell.
The marks of the lightning don’t show now. But
we both saw them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will hold to my own opinion still,” answered
Donald Reynolds, “and my uncle, though he would
like to, will not be able to disagree with me. Isn’t
it—hullo, there’s something wrong with the old
man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For Mr. Reynolds was leaning back in his chair
with his eyes closed, unmoving and unhearing.
Betsey ran to his side and took up one of his hands.
It was limp and lifeless, although she could feel the
faint pulse still beating. Donald, in evident concern,
was coming closer, but David barred the way
and warned him off.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are an impudent pair of young ones,” exclaimed
Donald. “Who are you and what is your
business here, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are friends of Miss Miranda’s,” Betsey explained
briefly. “I think you have done her father
some very great harm.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought it was only my duty to say a word or
two to put things right,” the man answered. “It
is not fair to Miranda that no one should tell her
father the truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did not speak one word of truth,” returned
David heatedly. “You guessed about the burning
of the house and you guessed wrong. And you did
not even guess about the invention. You know as
much of mechanical things as—as Dick does.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am a practical man,” Donald Reynolds said,
“and I have no patience with toys and dreams.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He spoke with less bluster than was to be expected,
for he seemed truly disturbed by the evident
harm he had brought about. His words roused his
uncle from the lethargy into which he had fallen
for the old man spoke suddenly and very clearly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are many idle dreams and some true
ones,” he said, “and it is only through the true
dreams that the world goes forward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he closed his eyes once more, drew a long
sigh and sank lower in the chair. Donald Reynolds
stood irresolute, troubled but unconvinced and ready
to argue his case still.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You had better go,” Betsey had the courage to
tell him with blunt plainness. “Mr. Reynolds will
be better when you are out of sight. There’s no use
in your waiting to talk to Miss Miranda.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Donald Reynolds, it seemed, thought the same
thing. He took up his hat, began to say something,
perhaps in apology or excuse for what he had done,
made such small success of it that he gave up the
attempt, and turned to the door. The two beside
Mr. Reynolds paid little attention to his going, only
Dick hailed his departure with a defiant caw.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose he is telling himself that he has acted
for the best,” commented David bitterly. “At
least he has sense enough to seem a little sorry for
what he has done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see now why Miss Miranda has looked so worried,”
Betsey added. “She has been afraid he
would come here and say just such cruel, untrue
things.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When David had brought a glass of water for
Mr. Reynolds and Betsey had propped him up with
cushions, he seemed to feel better, although still to
be rather dazed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did he mean it? Was he right?” he questioned
them pitifully, looking across at his well-beloved
wheels hanging in idleness. “Have I really
been so blind and selfish as to do Miranda such great
wrong?”</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed a long wait before they heard her step
outside.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go to meet her, tell her that—that nothing is
wrong,” he directed. “Do not let her be anxious.
I am sure you can explain it all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>David stayed by his side while Betsey went to tell
what had happened. It was not easy, especially
after she saw the look of alarm that came into her
friend’s face the moment she heard that Donald
Reynolds had been there. She listened quietly, however
to all that Betsey had to tell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, why was I away!” she exclaimed at the
end, but it was her only lamentation. “He can say
very hard and cruel things,” she added; “you have
not told me all of them, but I can guess.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She went to the workshop to speak to her father,
but David met her at the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He feels better,” the boy reported, “but he said
he would like to be by himself a little. He is up
and walking about; I really think he will be happier
if he is left alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They peeped in at the door and saw that Mr.
Reynolds was, as David had said, standing at the
bench, busy as ever, with a tool in his hand. He
was handling the wrench awkwardly, as though his
fingers had not much strength, but he appeared intent
and absorbed, almost himself again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elizabeth, nevertheless, was not satisfied. She
could not believe that any one so stricken as had been
Mr. Reynolds an hour before, could have really recovered
so quickly. Rather shyly she suggested that
she should stay all night, “just so that you will not
be all alone, if he should be ill again,” as she told
Miss Miranda, and, on her friend’s relieved acceptance
of the suggestion, was glad that she had
offered. David went across the hill to get the
things that she had telephoned to Anna to pack,
while Betsey mounted the stairs with Miss Miranda
to prepare a sleeping place.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have so few guests that I have no regular
spare bedroom,” her hostess explained. “If you
do not mind, you will have to sleep on the couch
here beside the toy-cupboard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Later, as she went to and fro about the house,
Elizabeth peeped in more than once to see how Mr.
Reynolds was faring in the workshop. She stood at
the door, not daring to speak or to disturb him, so
busy did he seem. His face looked white, deeply
lined and very tired; never had he appeared to her
so really old. He was toiling very earnestly so that
she felt sure he must be gaining some comfort from
his work. Once, however, when she looked in she
did not see him. The far corners of the room were
so very dim that he might be there among the
shadows, but she did not like to go in to make sure.
Miss Miranda called her for something at that moment
and kept her longer than she expected. Later,
when she went back to make sure of his absence before
she mentioned it, she saw that he was at work
again by the bench and she began to believe that she
must have been mistaken. He was standing beneath
the light, putting away a great array of tools
in a drawer.</p>

<p class='c007'>David, returning from his errand, came whistling
up to the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you sure you do not need a doctor?” he
inquired anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miranda was certain that a doctor would
only disturb and upset her father. She had broached
the subject to him earlier and had found the idea so
distressed him, that she had given it up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I met Michael when I came through the garden,”
David told Betsey, “and when I let him know
what had happened he seemed dreadfully upset.
He just sat down on the bench and groaned out, ‘I
knew that fellow would be coming here to make
some mischief, but I never knew quite what it would
be. And with me watching and watching for him,
he slipped in just the same. I was certain just some
such unlucky thing would happen, I have been feeling
it this long time back.’ Poor Michael, he will
probably be saying charms and repeating spells for
good luck all night now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you stay long enough on the wall to—to
see anything?” Betsey asked hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” he answered, “I waited minute after minute,
but the Thing was so slow, and what you said
had worried me too, so in the end I came away. I
will have to try again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was very late, so that David, after some lingering
and wishing that he could be of service, took his
leave, Betsey walking with him as far as the gate.
Here, in the moonlight they came upon Michael,
sitting on a three-legged stool, his pipe in his hand
and the collar of his worn coat turned up against
the dews of the spring night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is best that I should just wait here for a
while,” he explained. “I heard a step in the lane
and was afraid that blackguard might be back again.
Ah, what did I tell you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>For a figure had come into the moonlit open and
Donald Reynolds had laid a hand on the gate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will not be entering here, sir,” declared
Michael severely. “You have lived up, this night,
to what I always thought of you, but you have had
your fling and done your work and that has been
enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Donald shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You seem to have the place well guarded,” he
responded, “and I only came back for one thing.
They gave me some letters at the post office for my
uncle when I was getting my own, earlier in the day.
Somehow I forgot to leave them, so, when I found
them in my pocket, I brought them back rather than
have a delay on my conscience. I will be going
away early in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He gave the letters to Elizabeth, who took them
mechanically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And—and how is my uncle now?” he asked
hesitatingly; “if I had only known—if there is anything
I can do—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You were always a cruel one with your tongue,
Mr. Donald,” Michael interrupted him drily, “and
you should have learned by now that where words
have hurt, words cannot heal. It is against the nature
of things.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see, Michael, that you are the same stiff-necked
old bigot still,” returned the other. “Do you remember
how Ted and I caught you burning three
feathers of the black cock’s tail on Midsummer Eve,
to keep off bad luck for the year? Do you do such
things still?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To burn the whole black cock would not lift the
ill luck falling on the house that shelters you,” retorted
Michael hotly, “and if I do such things still
it is no concern of yours. But you will not be entering
this gate. Good night, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hint was so firm a one that Donald Reynolds
argued no further but turned away and strode out of
sight into the darkness. David was about to go
through the gate and follow him down the lane,
when Michael stopped him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go up and look at Mr. Reynolds again before
you go,” he begged. “I have a feeling that all is
not well with him, even yet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have so many feelings, Michael, how do
you know what they mean?” inquired David with
interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old man seated himself on his stool once
more and began filling his pipe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Men of Ireland are not quite like the rest of
the world,” he said slowly. “We do not often say
so, but I think it is in the hearts of all of us to think
that since our fathers’ fathers knew the Little People,
we of their blood can feel a little deeper and
see some things a little clearer than others. You
wouldn’t understand, not either of you, though you
have keen, kind eyes yourselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey looked back at him anxiously as they went
toward the house to fulfill his request. He was
lighting his pipe, the glow of the match shining
picturesquely on his battered features and mild blue
eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is too old to sit there in the damp and the
dark,” she said, “and I am afraid he will stay in
that one spot all night. But I suppose there is no
use in trying to persuade him not to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes, it was quite possible that Michael would sit
there all night in faithful guardianship of the people
he loved. He would have many quaint thoughts
for company so that the time would not be dull, he
would have memories of those wide, free plains and
towering mountains where he once was lonely lord
of thousands of sheep, memories of those giant,
white-coated dogs that sped to his rescue on the
night that Ted Reynolds had saved him and won his
devoted service for all time. But it was more likely
that his thoughts would wander farther yet, that it
was fairy hounds and fairy hills that his mind’s eye
would see, magic rings and dancing leprechauns and
many another thing that only Michael’s kind can
know. So clear would be his vision—as he grew a
little drowsy—that the very flowers and hedges
about him would seem crowded with tiny, rustling
figures and the warm night air be full of the beat of
little wings. For such a person as Michael, no night
spent in the garden could be really dull.</p>

<p class='c007'>As David and Elizabeth came to the workshop
door they were startled by a rush and flutter of black
feathers as Dick came flying out in great excitement.
Yet, within, the place seemed more peaceful than
ever. Mr. Reynolds had ceased his work and was
sitting at the table, a place once littered inches deep
with papers and tools, but now swept bare and clean.
His hands lay idly before him and he sat staring,
although it seemed he saw only the blank wall opposite.
Again it struck Betsey how unnatural was
the silence when those busy, familiar wheels stood
still. He looked up at them strangely when they
came in and said almost the same words he had
spoken before, his voice steady but unnaturally loud.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is through the true dreams that the world
goes forward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then after a moment’s pause he added—</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I have always said that a man could know
a true dream from a false one, could be sure when
he was working for a great good and not for a play-thing
and a failure. But I was wrong—all wrong!
Those wheels shall never turn again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His head dropped suddenly on his arm and rested
upon the table. Then his whole body slipped forward
and would have fallen had not David caught
him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chapX' class='c004'>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div>THE TOY CUPBOARD</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There could be no doubt that Mr. Reynolds
was very ill. A white-uniformed nurse was
installed at the cottage, the doctor came
daily, looking ever graver and graver, while there
were worried wrinkles in Miss Miranda’s forehead
and she began to look very thin and white. Mrs.
Bassett, the farmer’s wife, coming over to pay her
promised visit and finding her dear friend in such
trouble, arranged hastily that some one else should
take care of her own household and installed herself
in the kitchen so that Miss Miranda should be
free to wait upon her father. The old man lay, for
the greater part of the time, in a dull stupor, waking
only now and again to partial consciousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elizabeth and David gave all the help that they
could, but it seemed that there was little to be done.
Many nights Betsey spent at the cottage when she
guessed that Miss Miranda felt lonely and depressed,
although her friend’s cheerful spirit would
never admit failing courage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He will be better to-morrow,” she would keep
saying when it was found impossible to declare that
he was better to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey had another burden on her mind, the close
approach of her college examinations. She happened
to be of the sort that takes examinations with
difficulty, that cannot keep from worry, excitement
and misgivings beforehand. David’s, of course,
were coming also, and were far more formidable
than hers. The Scientific School which he was entering
had rigid requirements and offered a test of
knowledge in which not even the boy’s native wit
and his hard study could be certain of success.
There had been so many ups and downs in his education,
he had worked with so little guidance, that
there was no denying that the odds were against
him. He said little of his worries, however, merely
toiled away as the day came ever nearer.</p>

<p class='c007'>He and Elizabeth were apt to sit on the doorstep
of the cottage to do their lessons during these long
spring evenings that were beginning to change to
summer ones. One reason for their doing so was
that Miss Miranda liked to have them near, but it
was not to be denied that there was another one.
Neither one of them said much of that strange light
that they had seen moving about the ruins of the old
house, but both had clear remembrance of it and,
until they had opportunity to investigate it thoroughly,
had no special desire to sit at dusk beside
the starry pool.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miranda came out one evening to talk with
them on the stone step and to hear how their work
was faring. When questioned about her father she
was still able to answer cheerfully, although it was
plain that it cost some effort to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The doctor says that he may be ill a long time,”
she said at last. “He had been working hard, too
hard for any one who is so old, and for the last few
months, when he came near to the end of his experiments,
he had been under the pressure of great
excitement. And I think, though he would never
say so, that sometimes the very weariness and suspense
made him wonder if the invention was to be
a success. I know that he had written to one of his
scientific friends, the chief mechanical engineer for a
great construction company, to come and inspect the
new machine and that he was more disappointed
than he could quite hide, that there had been no answer.
He used to ask me several times a day about
the letters. So when Donald came—”</p>

<p class='c007'>The mention of letters had brought to Betsey such
a sudden recollection that she interrupted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There were some letters that night; your cousin
brought them, and they were never opened. Perhaps
one of them is what your father hoped for. I
think they are still lying on the table in his shop.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She sped away to fetch them with great eagerness
and came back with the handful of correspondence,
much of it evidently mere advertisements, but with
one slim envelope that had possibilities. There was
no chance that the stricken man upstairs could read
it, so that Miss Miranda, without hesitation, tore
the envelope open. Betsey and David watched her
face intently as she read.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is what he wished for,” she told them when
she had finished. “Mr. Garven, the man to whom
he wrote, seems to be much interested and even excited
about the new machine, for he says that the
gas turbine principle is one over which many people
have been working, but no one with any success.
He says that he will come to see it at any time that
my father appoints.” She refolded the letter
slowly. “It is rather bitter,” she added, with a
trifle of a catch in the voice that had been so brave
and steady until now, “rather bitter that this should
have come by Donald’s hand and just too late!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it is not too late,” Betsey protested with
vehemence. “David can show this man the machine,
he has helped your father and knows just how
it should run. And I am sure that the news that
the invention has been tested and proved a success
would help to make Mr. Reynolds well again. Oh,
do try it—do try it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was bouncing up and down on the doorstep in
her enthusiasm over the plan. To her great delight
David supported the idea heartily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no reason why any one who knows
about such things should not see in a moment that
the machine is a success,” he declared. “And it
would surely do all of us good to find that your
cousin was wrong.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It might be so,” Miss Miranda agreed slowly.
Elizabeth and David could actually hear the rising
hope in her voice. “We can at least try. Oh, if
it could only mean that things could right themselves
at last!”</p>

<p class='c007'>A telegram was dispatched by David that very
night and an anxious period of waiting was spent
thereafter at the white cottage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is to come on Monday afternoon, that’s the
day before our examinations begin,” Betsey told
David when the final message from Mr. Garven had
been received. She was so openly excited and impatient
that it seemed impossible to endure quietly
the slow passing of four days.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will help us to forget the examinations are so
near,” returned David.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was not often willing to admit his reluctance
to see approach that day when he was to try his fate,
but it was plain that he could not think of it with
much pleasure or confidence. It meant too much to
him, and the obstacles to his proper preparation had
been too great.</p>

<p class='c007'>Monday came, Monday morning, seeming to be
divided by the space of a year from Monday afternoon.
Even Miss Miranda was openly nervous and
as for Betsey, she could scarcely contain herself in
her agony of suspense. If the scientist who was
coming could actually pronounce the invention a success
it would mean not only the remedying of present
troubles that lay heavy on the household, but it
would mark the end of a long period of struggle,
self-denial and alternations of hope and discouragement.</p>

<p class='c007'>David met Mr. Garven at the train, with the two
assistants who had come with him, for this examination
of a new invention, produced by a man of
the reputation and skill of Mr. Reynolds, was no
small thing. Betsey scanned them anxiously as they
entered the house and observed that Mr. Garven
was gray-haired, with a clever, alert face, possibly the
same age as Miss Miranda’s father, but with more
of briskness and vigor. The time seemed endless
to her as they sat talking to their hostess in the living
room, but in reality it was brief, for it was
plainly the wish of every one that the business in
hand be reached at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miranda was very quiet, but Elizabeth
could see that her hand trembled as she opened the
door of the shop.</p>

<p class='c007'>“David will show you everything,” she told them.
It was evident that she spoke briefly because she was
too nervous to say more. She and Elizabeth lingered
by the door while David led the visitors forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the first time Betsey noticed the unusual order
of the place. Always before, when Mr. Reynolds
and David worked there, the shelves and
benches had been covered with tools and drawings
and the table piled with papers. She knew that no
person had recently put the room to rights, for no
one, not even David, dared move anything for fear
of misplacing it. Yet now the shop was so bare
and tidy that it seemed Mr. Reynolds himself must
have set things in final order, meaning truly never to
work there again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Along the walls were ranged the earlier machines
from which the great idea had developed, while at
the far end of the room stood the final model, the
perfected dream of ten years’ toil. It was the
same one that had run wild and attempted to ruin
itself on that day when Betsey and David came to
the rescue. The strangers bent over it examining
every crank and bolt with silent, intent interest.
There was nothing said for a long time. It was one
of the assistants who, bursting out at last, broke the
silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I always knew Reynolds would have it on
the rest of us,” he exclaimed delightedly, laughing
out loud in sheer pleasure at the greatness of the
achievement. “We all said that he had not disappeared
from view like this for nothing. And
now he has done what every one of us would have
given his eyes to accomplish!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” assented the older man slowly, “it is the
principle that we have all dreamed of, that only a
very great and a very patient man could bring to
reality at last. Now,” to David, “we will see it in
motion if you please, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is probable that all in the room held their
breaths as David laid his hand upon the lever. Betsey
was certain that she held hers and that she felt
all dry and hollow inside, so tense was her anxiety.
She listened for the familiar sound of turning
wheels, the smooth rising note as they spun into motion.
Every one listened—but the machine remained
silent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is something wrong, sir,” she heard David
say huskily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you have not thrown the proper
switch,” Garven suggested, but the boy shook his
head miserably.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have started it a hundred times,” he answered;
“there was never anything simpler. No, the machine
is not as it used to be. There must be some
parts missing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They went over it minutely, inch by inch, all four
of them, while Betsey and Miss Miranda still waited
by the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certain parts have been taken out,” David declared
at last, “the jets are missing and these valves
have been unscrewed. The machine can never go
without them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There followed a search in every drawer, on every
shelf, in each nook and cranny of the whole
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He seems to have put them away in some very
safe place,” an assistant said. “It is unfortunate
that he did not think that some one else might wish
to use them without him. Very unfortunate and
very strange.”</p>

<p class='c007'>David was standing in the middle of the room,
his eye on the table, once such a litter of papers but
now quite bare.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has burned all his drawings and plans,” he
observed, “and he must have destroyed those missing
parts. Do you remember, Betsey, he said the
machine should never run again!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But why, why?” demanded Garven. “This is
a thing I do not understand at all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They told him the whole story, there seemed no
reason for concealment. The older man heard it
through in silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We worked together years ago, Reynolds and
I,” he said at the conclusion, “and he was the same
as now, very ambitious, very tenacious of his purpose,
but sometimes overwhelmed with such tempests
of discouragement that he would wish to destroy
all that he had done. He was worn out, I
knew, his letter to me showed that, and he had a
hard and a cruel blow. He has brought us to the
edge of a very great discovery—and has left us
there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is he so ill, Miss Reynolds, that he cannot be
asked where the missing parts are?” questioned one
of the other men. “Surely if he knew that his
friend was here, he would want to have them produced.
Could you not ask him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is half-conscious at times,” Miss Miranda
answered doubtfully; “I might try.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I urge you to do so,” Garven said gravely.
“What he has here, if it can be proved a success
should mean a fortune to him, it should mean fame
and, most of all, it should mean a great step forward
in men’s knowledge. I think nothing should
be left untried.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miranda went out reluctantly; Betsey could
hear her hesitating feet upon the stairs, could hear
the door open above and the low sound of consultation
with the nurse. There was a long pause. One
man sat down, openly fidgeting and nervous, the
other stood twisting and untwisting a piece of wire
between his fingers. Garven was staring silently out
through the window. David still stood by the machine,
his back to the others, neither moving nor
speaking. It was a long, tense wait for them all.
It was because Dick had been banished for the afternoon,
Betsey thought, that the workshop seemed so
unnaturally still without him and without those ever-moving
wheels. After what seemed an endless time
they heard Miss Miranda coming back.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every face turned, even David wheeled about, but
a single glance showed the result of her errand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He roused himself a little,” she said; “he
seemed to understand that you were here and to be
trying to remember. And then he began to wander,
he talked vaguely of water and stars and that
was all. It is of no use.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They shook hands at last and went away, those
three men who had brought such hope with them and
could leave so little behind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will be in the neighborhood for a few days,”
Garven said as he bade Miss Miranda good-by.
“If there is anything I can do for you, my dear, be
sure to send for me. And if he should remember—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” she returned, shaking her head, “I will
not hope any longer. We have tried and failed and
the affair must be forgotten. It is all over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>David went away with them to the train and Miss
Miranda returned to her father. Betsey stood at
the door, watching as long as she could as they went
down the hill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, dear,” she sighed out loud at last, “oh,
dear!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hope had been so high that morning and now it
was quite dead. There came also over her a sudden
cold memory of something she had been glad to
forget. To-morrow were the examinations!</p>

<p class='c007'>She wandered disconsolately about the house, finding
it very empty. Michael was not in the garden,
Mrs. Bassett had gone on some errand, so that even
the kitchen was tenantless and quite silent save for
the clock ticking on the wall. She sighed again as
she glanced up at it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Such a long day,” she lamented, “and there are
hours of it left!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Very slowly she went upstairs at last. She did
not wish to disturb Miss Miranda, but she was too
miserable and lonely to stay longer by herself. The
sick-room door was open as she stole past, so that
she could see within the nurse alone beside the bed.
Miss Miranda must be in the sitting room, busy
with her knitting or some work that would comfort
her a little.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Miss Miranda was not knitting. She was
seated before the old mahogany desk as Betsey entered,
she had opened the glass doors wide and was
setting the whole contents of the shelves on the flat
space before her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was hoping you would soon come upstairs,”
she said to Elizabeth. “Have I ever shown you
this silver ball that came from India or told you
the story that was brought with it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey was never to forget that afternoon.
Treasure after treasure Miss Miranda set before
her, tale after tale she told, that carried her listener
so far away that trouble, disappointment, misgivings
for the morrow, were all forgotten. There were
stories of strange foreign lands where sea-faring
Reynolds forbears had journeyed to find endless
adventures and to bring home tales of the glittering,
colorful Orient. There were stories of her
own youth, of her brother’s absurd mishaps and
deeds of daring, stories of the Northern woods
where they had camped, of tramping journeys they
had taken together over forested hills and marshy
valleys, where moose called at twilight and deer
broke cover as they came near. The hours sped,
the hot sunlight moved across the room, touched the
ceiling and was gone, the hard day was over. The
nurse came to the door and said that Mr. Reynolds
was better, was conscious and was asking for his
daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Miranda,” said Betsey as, a little later
they were returning the ornaments to the shelves
where they belonged, “it was I that should have
comforted you to-day, but you helped me instead.
I don’t understand how you know such wonderful
things to tell, or have such strange treasures in your
toy-cupboard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miranda smiled. She seemed quite brave
and cheerful again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“People all have toy-cupboards,” she answered,
“hidden away somewhere in their hearts and minds.
There are many who keep them always locked, store
their memories and treasures there and never look at
them again. But I think you should keep the doors
open and, when things go wrong, when you are tired
and discouraged and your spirit fails, you should
take out your treasures and go over the beautiful
things of the past and let yourself see again the
quaint and curious and happy things that your life
has held. If you do that I think you can never be
quite unhappy, never can quite lose courage, never
really grow old.”</p>

    <div>RUNNING WATER</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was a thrush, singing in the early morning
rain, that awakened Betsey next day. She had
slept at the cottage, on the couch beside the
toy-cupboard and had seen through the window, as
she dropped asleep, the sky all bright with stars and
had thought vaguely of how they must be shining in
the pool. Through her dreams, however, she had
heard, toward the dawn, the patter of rain on the
sloping roof above her head and she had remembered
how dry the grass was growing and how
thirsty the garden, and had smiled to hear it fall.
The thrush seemed to be glad also, for he sat just
opposite her window, hidden among the wet leaves,
and singing with all his soul to greet the gray
morning. She got up and knelt by the casement to
watch him, while he, too intent upon his trills and
warbles and flute-like runs, seemed to pay no heed
to the fact that some one was peering at him over
the sill. When he had finished and flown away,
when the cool rain had ceased and the sun was beginning
to send long rays into the dripping garden,
she remembered for the first time that this was the
long-dreaded day, the morning of the examinations.</p>

<p class='c007'>For some reason that she could not explain, she
no longer minded the thought at all. The events of
the day before had seemed to clear her mind, to
drive the cobwebs from her brain, to give her
courage. David, she knew, when there was nothing
more he could do in preparation, had begun to
look forward to the occasion since the very fact that
the chances were against him lent some excitement
to the affair. What he did know he had mastered
well, but did he know the right things? He had
reached a point where he was quite on edge to find
out. It was necessary for him to take his examinations
at the college itself, so that he would be
gone for the three days that they lasted and would
not see Betsey again until the trials of both of them
were over. As she dressed and went downstairs
she was so busy wishing him luck that she had little
time to think of herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>After all her nervous worry, she was astonished
at her present calm, that lasted even while she sat in
the big quiet school room with fifty others, waiting
for questions to be distributed. The one thought
that kept going through her head, oddly enough,
was, “I am so glad I did not go with Aunt Susan!”
The paper was handed to her, Plane and Solid Geometry,
the most difficult subject first as it should
be. She smiled joyfully as she saw, like the face
of an old friend looking up at her, the question concerning
the frustum of a pyramid.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was three days later and the last of the trial
was over. Elizabeth had felt unexcited throughout,
but now was beginning to seem a little jaded,
as though the pouring out of so much knowledge
had left her limp and empty. She had not seen
much of Miss Miranda, so full had the days been,
merely contenting herself with telephoning or consulting
with Mrs. Bassett at the kitchen door. But
now she was climbing the hill again, with none too
energetic feet, to be sure, and rather a dull and
vacant head, but with a heart lightened of a very
definite burden. She could not know her exact
standing for some days, but she had, she admitted to
herself frankly, no great doubt as to the result.
Nothing had seemed very difficult, for steady and
conscientious labor had proved its value at last. She
felt rather more concerned about David. His
work, also, would be finished to-day, so that she
might hope to see him at the cottage that evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>A telegraph messenger passed her, coasting joyously
down the hill on his bicycle as she was toiling
upward. At the gate she found Michael, the yellow
dispatch still in his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m going in, shall I take it to Miss Miranda?”
she said, but the old Irishman shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is for me,” he answered, and, as though to
prove it, turned the envelope so that she could see
the address, “Mr. Michael Martin, Somerset Lane.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Michael somehow seemed rather an unexpected
person to be receiving telegrams, but he was in one
of his silent moods, unfortunately, and did not offer
to tell his news.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am needing help in the garden,” was all he
condescended to say as he pocketed the envelope;
“could you give me a hand with pulling the lettuce?
Miss Miranda has not been able to come inside the
place for a week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll just go in and speak to her first,” Elizabeth
said, a remark that seemed to displease him greatly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As you will,” he returned, shrugging his shoulders
grumpily, “but it will be dark before long and
plenty of time for visiting then. It will be black
darkness, too, for there is no moon now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a sigh Betsey agreed that he was probably
right and that he should, at any rate, be humored.
The garden did indeed look neglected and in want
of the care Miss Miranda was accustomed to give
it. The very hens and ducks seemed to be moping
and less cheerful in their clucks and quackings, as
though they missed their mistress and found the
unsympathetic Michael a very sorry substitute.
When Betsey was once established between the lettuce
rows he went away at once to hoe the sweet
corn, so that conversation was impossible.</p>

<p class='c007'>They labored in silence for a long time until it
began to grow too dark to see clearly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will not stop before he does,” Betsey told herself,
rather nettled at his uncordial behavior; “he
will think I am shirking if I do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fresh green lettuce heads had grown huge and
compact like gigantic roses and filled, heaping full,
the big basket he had set beside her. She went on
thinning them out, pulling chance weeds, clipping the
long stalks, determined to make no move until the
unapproachable Michael suggested it. She thought
much of David as she worked there in the dusk.
Had he done well or had chance gone against him?
Would he come soon to report how things were or
would his return be so late that she would have to
wait until morning to hear how he had fared? With
a little good luck he should have got through famously
but, somehow, good luck had not lately
seemed to be the order of the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am beginning to be just like Michael,” she reproved
herself severely when she reached this point
in her meditations. It was fortunate that she did
not speak aloud for there was the old gardener himself,
just behind her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She thought that he had come to bid her stop
working but, instead, he stood leaning on his hoe,
saying nothing. But he was there with something
to say, that was evident, for presently, having
shifted his feet once or twice and cleared his throat,
he was able to begin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Betsey,” he said slowly, “you don’t believe
in bad spirits, do you, the kind that bring ill
luck to people that deserve only the best and fairest
fortune on earth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was quite startled that his thoughts and hers
should have been following so closely the same channel,
but she would not admit the fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Michael, I don’t,” she answered firmly.
“Do you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not sure that I don’t, nor yet that I do,”
he replied doubtfully; “sometimes I think I have
let my fancies run away with me my whole life
through, so now that I am a foolish old man, I
cannot believe my own senses. You don’t think for
instance—” he lowered his voice almost to a whisper
and looked at her keenly through the shadows,
“you don’t think that there is anything queer amiss
up yonder at the old house?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Michael!” cried Betsy, too much astonished to
keep up her pretense of calmness. “Michael, have
you noticed it too? What was it you saw?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was not so much what I saw, for my eyes are
dim and old now, it was what I heard. On the very
night when Mr. Donald was here and Mr. Reynolds
was stricken, that was when I heard. Something
moving in the dark, something that muttered to Itself,
that stood by the pool for a minute there in the
black and white of the moonlight. I heard the
water splash like a fish jumping, but I am thinking
it was more like a charm for bad luck being dropped
in, as such Creatures love to do. I used to think
that the bad spell was only on the old house but it is
on the water now also, on that pool that lies so
deep and quiet and pictures back the stars. If it
was running water, now, the spell would carry away,
but not with a still basin as that is, the evil lies there
so quiet and works and works—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Michael,” cried Betsey, “you should not believe
such things!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d like to put it by,” he declared, “but how
can a man do so? Can you deny there is sorrow
come to this house, undeserved and unforeseen?
Yes, the curse of ill luck will lie on a house until
some one knows how to drive it away. And the
best time for lifting such a spell is in the hour before
midnight and in the dark of the moon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey stood up and took her basket.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not going to believe what you say,” she
insisted stoutly, “and I am going in to see Miss
Miranda. You have not told me yet how her father
is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had orders not to tell you until I must,” he
said gently. “He is worse, much worse. The doctor
has been here all day and Miss Miranda looks
like a ghost.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh,” cried Betsey in distress, then added with
almost a sob of relief, “Oh, here’s David!”</p>

<p class='c007'>For David, striding out of the shadows, seemed
a very comforting presence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I nailed them,” he announced elegantly the moment
he came near. “The examiners were a clever
set of fellows, they managed to guess at all the
things I knew and to ask me about very little else.
I make them my compliments. And now, how are
things going?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He heard the bad news in troubled silence, took
up Elizabeth’s basket without a word and turned to
the house. Poor old Michael stood staring after
them, hopeless and distressed, unable to speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miranda stood by the door, talking to the
doctor who was just going.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is quieter,” the doctor was saying, “and the
night may pass easily. But if he should be delirious
again—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will be here, sir,” David announced briefly,
at his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will? Good, you can be of some help if
things go badly. And be sure to call me the moment
there is any change. If there were only something
that would rouse him from that stupor!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miranda looked much like a shadow, but
she greeted them as cheerily as ever and seemed most
eager to know how their affairs had gone during the
last three days, and was as happy as they were in
the hopeful report of results.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was rather worried about David,” she admitted,
and he confessed cheerfully that he had been
much worse than worried about himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At the last minute I began quite to enjoy the
excitement of it,” he declared, “but I don’t care to
go through it a second time. I will never cut things
quite so close again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The cottage was to be crowded that night for
Elizabeth was to sleep there, upon Miss Miranda’s
urging it, and David, since there were no more spare
beds, undertook to make up a couch for himself on
one of the low benches in the workshop. Elizabeth
had opportunity, while Miss Miranda had gone to
fetch some blankets, of telling David that Michael,
too, had been seeing strange things in the garden
of the ruined house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can guess what Michael thought if he saw that
moving light,” the boy observed. “He would have
a hundred explanations where we have not been able
to find one. When we get some of these other affairs
off our minds, we will have to go and watch for
it again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Y—yes,” assented Betsey. She was not entirely
sure whether she cared to investigate further.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is one thing that I have found out,” he
went on. “I came across the grounds of the old
house this evening while it was still light, to gather
up some of the books I used to keep there and that
I will not use again. And I found that these last
spring storms have weakened and washed out those
broken walls worse than ever, so that nothing but
a ghost or goblin could walk over them without
coming to grief.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey said good night to David, good night to
Miss Miranda, tiptoed down the dimly lighted hall
and closed the door of her own room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must go to sleep early,” Miss Miranda had
said. “I know you are tired after your hard three
days.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Weary she was, but not sleepy at all. She felt
a restless uneasiness nor, try as she would, could
she shake off the haunting depression caused by
Michael’s fantastic notion. She sat by the window,
watching big dark clouds creep upward from the
horizon and blot out the stars, she wandered about
the room, she tried to read, she tried to sleep, but
all to no purpose. It was impossible to put out of
her mind the seriousness of Mr. Reynolds’ illness,
nor could she forget Michael’s solemn belief that ill
luck lay heavy on the place and would not be driven
away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s nonsense,” she told herself again and again.
“Why did I ever listen to him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The pressure of excitement and distress became
greater and greater instead of less, became almost
unendurable. She sat down before Miss Miranda’s
desk and lifted her hand to the key of the toy-cupboard
How often she had read in fairy stories of
how the heroine of the tale, when in complete despair,
would break the magic nut, uncover the enchanted
box for a charm to bring help in time of
need. She felt as though it were much the same
thing she was doing when she opened the doors of
the toy cupboard.</p>

<p class='c007'>One after another she took down the treasures
and set them before her, the silver Saint Christopher,
the little jade tree, the bowls and cups, the
ornaments and carvings. She tried to recollect the
stories she had heard but a few days ago, the gay
adventures, the odd, absorbing tales. Yet she came
wandering back to the two of which she had heard
first, the silver saint and the little tree. They
seemed to be more closely bound up with her daily
life, with Michael’s superstition and with that steadfast
purpose that dwelt in the Reynolds’ blood.
From the two friends who built their clipper ship in
the face of all opposition down to Miss Miranda
and her father, all were willing to sacrifice so much
and work so untiringly to put into reality the substance
of a dream. She set the tree on the shelf
again and in doing so brushed Saint Christopher to
the ground. Poor Michael, what strange ideas had
taken possession of his faithful old Irish soul!</p>

<p class='c007'>“That pool that lies so deep and quiet and pictures
back the stars. If it was running water,
now!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Why did his rambling, senseless talk keep running
through her head? Little by little, however,
calm and comfort seemed to come back to her and
at last, so late did she sit before the toy cupboard
that drowsiness came from mere force of habit and
she got up and stumbled to her bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>She slept soundly, but for a very little time,
awakening with a start. The rising clouds had
brought high winds with them, winds that were
blustering about the corners of the little house and
blowing sticks and broken boughs across the steep
roof above her head. Starting up with all sleepiness
vanished, she sat staring into the dark. There was a
sound above the others that she did not quite recognize,
a sound like a door banging or—no—it was
the slamming of a gate. Again and again she heard
it, an unlocked gate swinging in the wild night wind.
There was none near enough for her to hear so
plainly save the one in the high garden wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then suddenly there came into her mind, not
gradually as answers to puzzles often come, but all
at once, full, clear and plain, the truth as to that
mystery of the goblin light. Why had she been so
dense before, why had she thought of it so late,
when real harm might have already come? She
fumbled for her clothes in the dark, stumbling here
and there in too great haste even to find the lamp;
she dressed pell-mell, flung open the door and ran
down the stairs. She was quiet in the upper hall,
but, in her hurry, had little thought of silence as
she unbarred the outer door.</p>

<p class='c007'>The high, warm wind whirled her halfway across
the lawn the moment she stepped off the doorstep.
The gate in the wall was swinging open just as she
had guessed, the path beyond stretched away like
a black tunnel through the trees. She was afraid,
she hated to go alone, she felt very small and powerless
in all that empty darkness. Why had she not
stopped to call David? But no, it would have
taken more time than she could afford to lose.
She was buffeted by the wind, brushed with ghostly
hands by the low-reaching shrubs; she was half sobbing
with terror, but nevertheless she ran onward.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div>THE DARK OF THE MOON</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The wide circle of open lawn before the
ruined house was less dark than the pathway,
but the shadows beneath the trees were
inky black and the pines themselves were bowing and
thundering in the heavy storm. There was no rain,
only the boisterous wind whipping the branches and
driving great masses of clouds across the sky with
now and then a gleam of stars between. Stars
glinted now and again in the pool also, long beams
of light in the ruffled water, although, as she came
near, there chanced to be quiet for a moment so that
she saw reflected the irregular circle of light that
Miss Miranda had told her was the Northern
Crown.</p>

<p class='c007'>She stood still by the pool for a long minute, her
heart beating very loud, the pulses throbbing in her
ears as it does after running. Very keenly she was
peering into the dark at the long lines of ruined
walls, seeing nothing at first, but by and by catching
glimpses of a tiny, moving light. It stopped,
vanished, reappeared, and moved on before she
could be certain that she really saw it. At last it
came nearer, moving along past the door that David
had used, slipped over the tumbled wall, even showed
double for a second in the shattered old mirror.
She was trying to speak, to cry out, but she could
not find her voice, could only stare, fascinated, quaking
inwardly with the thought that the light, after
all, might be something unearthly. But as it progressed
farther toward the end of the house where
the fire had raged fiercest, the sense of danger
brought her to her senses at last.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop,” she cried frantically. “It is not safe
there. Stop, come back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She had called a second too late. There was a
sound of rending walls and tumbling bricks, a crash,
a startled cry and then a groan. She rushed across
the grass, could find no place to climb over and ran
up and down wildly, seeking a point of vantage
where she might scramble across. A new sound
caught her attention, for flying feet were coming up
the path.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, David, David is it you?” she cried, in an
overwhelming rush of relief. “I can’t climb up, I
can’t reach him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are not to try it, it is not safe,” David ordered
sternly, setting his foot on the first big block
of stone even as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going where you go,” she replied and evidently
he realized it was no time for argument.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then this is the best way over. Here, give me
your hand, and be careful of that loose beam.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They scrambled over the summit and, amid a
shower of sliding bricks, slipped down on the other
side. A dark figure lay stretched upon the stones,
moving a little and still holding a flickering, lighted
candle. It was Michael.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Miss Betsey dear,” he affirmed cheerfully,
when they had at last brought him to recognize who
they were, “and I’ve a broken leg I’m thinking from
the way it feels by not having any feeling at all.
And will you hold up the candle and see what is
running down my face?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Michael, Michael, what were you doing,
how could you be so foolish?” Betsey reproached
him; “your head is cut and what is running over
your face is blood.” She began, forthwith, to try
to tie it up with her handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then glory be to all the Saints,” was Michael’s
unexpectedly joyful reply; “there is nothing that
will break the charm of ill luck like the letting of
blood. It will all go well now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey looked helplessly at David. Was the
poor old man gone out of his wits entirely?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you know better than to risk your life
over such nonsense? Won’t you ever learn better,
Michael?” David said severely, although the pathetic
broken figure on the stones was one to call
forth only pity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” assented the old Irishman meekly, “I
know better and the priest is always telling me so.
But yet—when there’s trouble to them you love
and seemingly no way out of it, why, you look back
at the old fancies and wonder if they were not true
after all, and you feel the need to try this thing or
to try that thing, just in case there might be help
in it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what were you doing here?” David asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is on this house that the ill luck lies, for it
was in its burning that the evil fortune began and it
is only through its building up again that happiness
can come back to Miss Miranda. And so—and
so—just to make the luck change, it is the old way
to take a candle in your hand and to walk through
every part of the house saying spells as you go.
And the last of the spells must be said in the hour
before midnight in the dark of the moon. But Miss
Betsey stopped me,” he concluded regretfully.
“This was to be the last night, yet I did not get the
whole of the way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She came just in time,” David corrected him.
“The walls beyond here are weaker even than these,
and high enough to bury you completely if they
should fall. I was awake and heard the gate swinging,
and I was trying to think how it came to be
open, but it was Betsey that was quick enough to
understand in time. When she ran down the stairs
I got up to follow her, yet I really did not guess what
was happening until I heard you fall. You must
thank her that you are still alive.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But if the bad luck still holds,” protested
Michael pitifully, “then it will be all to do over
again!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was silent as though gathering strength for
further speech and then began once more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I must tell you that what has been going
amiss is, the whole of it, through fault of mine.
There was a day, it was before you ever came to the
cottage, when Mr. Donald was last here that—that—”
His voice faltered, perhaps through
weakness, perhaps through reluctance to go on, but
he drew a breath and continued bravely. “That
very morning, when I was getting my breakfast I
spilled the salt dish and I thought to myself,
‘Michael Martin, you will be losing your temper
with some one this day.’ But who was there for
me to quarrel with except Miss Miranda and her
father and the good Saints know I could never be
vexed with them. So I went about my work and
thought no more about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But that afternoon I went over to the old house,
it was late winter still and I was wishing to gather
some pine cones for Miss Miranda’s hearth, and,
for all the cold, I sat down on a stone to smoke a
pipe and think about the old times and how happy
we all were before the fire came. And there was
Mr. Donald, walking about the broken walls, peering
here and peering there, but not stepping within
for he is of the sort that are always careful of the
safety of their precious skins.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped again to rest his trembling voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t try to tell us, Michael, if it is so hard,”
Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must tell you, Miss Betsey,” he replied, “I
have hid it in my heart too long. He says to me, ‘I
am just looking to see where the fire really started,
it seems that it must have been at this end where the
workshop stood.’ I says ‘Yes, sir,’ not being wishful
to have any talk with him. And after a little he
says again, ‘It was a beautiful old place. I can see
plainly why Miranda longs for it and cannot be
happy where she is.’ And this time I says nothing
but puffs away at my pipe. It roused my anger,
some way, to see him peering about, though I am a
slow-witted fellow and had no guess at what he was
looking for. At last he speaks once more. ‘Why
don’t they build it up again, Michael?’ he says.
‘They could if they weren’t such a careless impractical
pair. They should be living here again,
I have no patience with them.’ Then my wrath
boils up in me and I tells him what I thinks. ‘You
have no patience, have you,’ says I, ‘with them that
took you in and cared for you and bore with those
ways you have that no one likes. You’re prosperous
yourself through their help, if you want them
to rebuild their house why don’t you give them aid
in doing it? Miss Miranda toils and saves and
has her garden and her ducks and anything she can
think of to make things go forward, so that her
father will have what he needs for his work.’ All
of that I says to him and I wish the Saints had struck
me dumb before I spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘She works so that her father may have what
he needs?’ he repeats. ‘So that is how things
stand, just as I had been suspecting. Thank you,
Michael, that is all I wanted to know,’ he says and
goes, leaving me gaping after him as he walks away
over the snow. I did not know even then what use
he was to make of what I had told him, but I saw
well enough that I had done harm. And so I have
been doing all I could to make amends,” he ended
sadly; “I have watched over the house that he
should never come near with Miss Miranda not
there, though I guessed but little what it was he
would do. And when it seemed of no use and I
felt helpless and afraid, thinking of the mischief I
had done, I have turned to trying to drive away the
ill luck in the old fashion, with spells and charms,
just—just because there might be something in
them after all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He ceased speaking and closed his eyes, worn out
by the effort of confession.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He used to watch by the garden gate long before
Miss Miranda’s cousin ever showed himself,”
was Betsey’s whispered comment to David. “He
was sitting there on the bench in the dark, that night
we sat by the pool and Miss Miranda told us the
story of the green jade tree. He was probably
watching on the very evening that Donald Reynolds
finally came.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” David reminded her bitterly, “and slipped
away on a chase after a will-o’-the-wisp, lit his candle
and came up here to this place when he might have
been of some real use at home. He even brought
us there after him, though he did not know it, just
at the time when the man he dreaded had really
come. If he had only been sensible—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t let him think of that,” said Betsey. “Yes,
he went at just the wrong minute but he must be kept
from remembering it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Michael must have suspected that their whispered
discussion concerned the truth of his strange notions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe I was wrong,” he said miserably, “but
did not my own eyes see Something stand there by
the pool, did not my ears hear a splash in the water
that boded no good. If it had only been running
water—”</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey felt David start suddenly in the dark.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say that again, Michael,” he ordered breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old Irishman repeated the words faithfully,
even to the groan at the end of them. David’s excitement
was rapidly communicating itself to Betsey.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was on the night Miss Miranda’s father
was taken ill,” she said, although of this explanation
there was no need.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know, I know,” the boy returned quickly, “but
wasn’t Mr. Reynolds in his shop all the rest of the
evening? That is what has puzzled me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I looked in once and he was gone,” she answered,
“but it was for such a little while that I
never thought of it again. Oh, if we should find
what is lost, at last!”</p>

<p class='c007'>David was already on his feet, peering over the
stone wall toward the pool.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We should try to get Michael home first,” Betsey
objected, seeing already what was in his mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no,” the Irishman insisted, having only a
vague notion of what they were about, but feeling
excitement in the air. “You shall not move me one
inch if there is aught to do first that may help Miss
Miranda.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must lie very still,” warned Betsey.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed and I will,” promised Michael obediently,
“but—what is it you are going to do, you
two?”</p>

<p class='c007'>They did not stop to explain, so great was their
haste. They went clambering over the wall again,
and tumbled down the other side upon the grass.
The wind, from which they had been sheltered below,
caught them again as they ran to the pool.
They knelt down at opposite sides of the shallow
curve and plunged their arms, shoulder deep, into
the tossing water.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have found something,” exclaimed Betsey almost
immediately; “it feels like thin metal blades
set in a ring.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She drew her prize, dripping, from the basin and
held it up. As she sat back on her heels the wind
loosened her hair and flung its dark mass over her
shoulder. David, unable to see, took the object
in his hand and felt of it carefully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is certainly the missing valve,” he pronounced,
“so we know now that we are right. The
other parts were two steel tubes, about as long as
my hand. Those will not be so easy to find. They
may have rolled away to the deep end.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No amount of fumbling on the bottom revealed
anything further except that Betsey, lifting a stone,
grasped a frog that was beneath it and almost
tumbled into the water with the dreadful start its
slippery little body caused her. She sat up, panting,
and attempted to wring out her wet sleeve.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What if we could not find them after all,” she
lamented. “Mr. Reynolds must have meant that
no one, not even himself, should ever have them
again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But David was not willing to give up so easily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is like a needle in a haystack,” he admitted,
“but even such things have been found.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He poised himself at the edge of the basin, then
slid into the water with the clean straight dive of an
expert swimmer. Once he went down, and twice,
and came up empty handed. The third time he was
gone so long that the water quieted and the reflected
stars shone once more in their places. Betsey, leaning
over to watch in an agony of apprehension, felt
her tired spirit completely give way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, David,” she wailed, although under her
breath, “don’t be drowned and leave me alone in
the dark.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As though in answer to her words a widening
circle suddenly appeared on the surface and David’s
head rose at the center of the pool. He gasped
and spluttered and shook the water from his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have them,” he announced joyfully, “one in
each hand. Now we have found them all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He came clambering out on the edge of the basin,
the water pouring from him in streams, his red head
sleek and shining.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I got a little short of breath that last time,” he
admitted. “I kept touching the things and they
kept rolling away, I thought I would never get them
in my hands. They would have rusted to bits in a
little longer; we have not found them at all too
soon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Michael’s wits seemed to be wandering a little
when they returned to him, nor did he appear to
understand very clearly the account that, both speaking
excitedly, they poured into his ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course, of course,” he kept repeating a little
impatiently, “did I not tell you that the secret of the
ill luck charm lay in the pool of stars?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did, Michael,” Betsey agreed soothingly at
last, “but you see we did not quite understand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now,” said David, getting up, “I am going
back to the cottage to telephone for the doctor and
to bring help to carry Michael home. It will not
be long.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey sat very quiet after he had gone. The
wind whooped and whirled overhead, bowing the
trees and beating back and forth the branches of the
vines and shrubs. All at once she began to hear a
strange cracking, a grating of stones and the snapping
of ivy stems, the crushing of bushes, then an
appalling rumble that grew to a deafening crash of
falling stone. Even in the sheltered corner where
they were, the ground rocked and a cloud of gritty
dust blew in upon them, almost choking them both.
Michael, startled, actually managed to raise himself
on his elbow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What was that?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The wind has carried down the last walls that
were standing in the south wing,” she replied.
“David said that they have been crumbling for
years and that lately, with feet going back and forth
over them, they have grown more and more ready
to fall. I am glad you did not go farther, you
might have been hurt worse than this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old man’s brain seemed to have been aroused
by the shock into a moment of absolute clearness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should have been buried entirely, I am thinking,”
he remarked, “and there would have been an
end to an old fool and his whims and fancies. I
sought to set things right in my own way and have
done nothing but harm, while it is you and Mr.
David have found out all the trouble by your plain
good sense and loyal friendship, and will know how
to mend what has gone amiss. It is your standing
so firm by Miss Miranda that has made things go
well again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it was you who told me to stand by her,”
Betsey reminded him comfortingly. “I would never
have dreamed that I could help her if you had not
told me so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was quiet a little but presently spoke again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When they come to carry me home it may be
the pain of lifting me over the wall will disorder
my wits once more. So I should tell you what was
to be a secret, that Mr. Ted comes home to-day.
That was why I was so anxious the bad luck should
be gone on this very night, and thanks to you, it is.
He was not quite certain of the time and did not wish
to disappoint his sister, so it was to old Michael he
sent the message to be on the watch for him. We
were always great friends, Mr. Ted and me, and
to think that the blessed Saint Christopher has
brought him home safe at last.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He must have made an effort to tell this, feeling
that his senses were once more slipping from him
for almost immediately he went off again into confused
muttering.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He saved my life,” he said once, more clearly,
“he saved my sheep, him and those great beautiful
white dogs, but—” the thread of consciousness had
snapped again—“they were always the hunters,
those greyhounds of the King of Connemara;
though they lived a thousand years ago you can hear
their cry over the hills to this day!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was, to Betsey, a moment of great relief, when
she heard feet upon the grassy pathway, saw the
gleam of lanterns through the rifts in the broken
walls and knew that help had come. Later, however,
there was a very hard hour at the old man’s
tiny cottage when the doctor attended to his broken
leg and the gash in his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He will get through all right,” was the cheerful
assurance given when the affair was over. “I have
attended Michael before, he gets himself into many
scrapes but he always comes out of them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The nurse had come down to give assistance, but
she and the doctor were both needed at Mr. Reynolds’
bedside. When questioned about Miss Miranda’s
father, the doctor merely shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>They went away, leaving Betsey to watch Michael
alone, since David also had betaken himself to the
cottage. She sat for hour after long hour until
it was beginning to be morning, as she could see
from her place by the bed near the tiny window.
The birds were singing; perhaps it was that same
thrush that had greeted her before, that was swinging
from the drooping elm tree and calling its welcome
to the dawn. Michael was sleeping peacefully,
she felt very weary herself as she sat there
watching the gray light turn slowly to bright day.
A step fell on the threshold, a heavy step that could
be none other than Mrs. Bassett’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These are the strangest doings that ever I heard
of,” she exclaimed as she came in, taking off her
coat and putting on her apron almost with the same
motion. “To think that I slept through it all and
never knew a thing until that boy, tinkering in the
workshop before it was light, happened to wake me.
I’ve got the breakfast ready up there at Miss
Miranda’s, and set everything to rights and now I
am just going to stay here while you go back and get
some sleep. What a time you have had, poor dear!
They say Mr. Reynolds has got through the night
a little better than they hoped, though there is still
nothing that will rouse him from that stupor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun was really up and shining as Betsey passed
through the garden toward the cottage. The
world was very clean and glittering and very still,
with only the old cock strutting across the poultry
yard and lifting his voice in a loud, full crow that
sounded far through the quiet of the dawn. It was a
pleasant, homely, familiar sound after the strange
adventures and unrealities of the night. Betsey began
to wonder if it had not indeed been all a dream
and she would not presently discover that she had
dropped asleep before the toy-cupboard, the tree
of jade or the silver Saint Christopher in her hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Black Dick, strutting and fluttering before the
workshop, seemed to be telling her, before she could
run across the grass to the door, that something of
great moment was going on inside. David was busy
with his back toward her, a very jubilant and excited
David, still in the damp, bedraggled clothes of
last night’s adventures, but whistling gayly and
handling wrench and hammer as though life itself
depended on his speed. He looked at her over his
shoulder, smiling his widest and happiest smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t go,” he said, breathless and eager, “don’t
go. Something—something is just going to happen!”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was the snapping of a switch and the slow
creak of a lever that had not recently been moved.
Then followed a faint and rising hum, a whir of
wheels grew louder and deeper, that filled the
death-like silence of the room with gay song, that
sounded over the garden and through the house, that
reached the ears of the invalid upstairs and made
him stir and smile and open his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey listened enthralled, too filled with breathless
delight to heed any other sound. Yet the gate
from the lane was flung hastily and noisily open and
a man in uniform came striding up the path. She
did not even heed when Dick, with joyous cawing,
spread wide black wings to fly to the stranger’s
shoulder, she only looked up, startled, to see him
standing in the inner hallway beyond the workshop
door. There was something of Miss Miranda in
his bearing, something of her spirit in his dancing
eyes. And his voice, somehow, had a faint ring of
her father’s when he called up the stair, the same
familiar call, but with no note of worried helplessness
like Mr. Reynolds’, only the ringing tidings of
a brother’s long-desired homecoming—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miranda, oh, Miranda.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='conclusion' class='c004'>CONCLUSION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The summer had slipped away, the garden on
the hillside was golden instead of green and
old white Dobbin was plowing for autumn’s
sowing instead of spring’s. Michael, possessed still
of a slight limp and a scar on his seamed forehead,
but hale and lusty as before, dug among the potatoes
and had no one to tempt him from his habitual
silence. Miss Miranda was busy elsewhere and
as for Elizabeth and David, the garden and the yellow
fields knew them no more.</p>

<p class='c007'>Betsey’s father had come home and had set up
his housekeeping in the college town so that he and
his daughter need not be separated again. Aunt
Susan also had returned, laden with souvenirs, curios,
new clothes, and glorious accounts of what she had
seen. The descriptions, however, like her collection
of photographs, were apt to become a little
jumbled when brought out for exhibition, so that
Betsey was never really quite certain whether Bermuda
was chiefly delightful for its mountain ranges or
its shopping, or whether Lake Louise, a marvel of
scenic wonder as she understood, was situated in the
Canadian Rockies or the Garden of the Gods. As
a result she could not feel any sharp or definite regret
for what she had missed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The completed invention had brought Miss
Miranda’s father both fame and fortune, even as
his scientist friend had prophesied, and what was
better, had won him back to health. The first result
of its success was that the ruined walls of the
old house had vanished and the big, gray, beautiful
building was going up again under the hands of an
army of workmen. Mr. Reynolds could be seen
upon the lawn, superintending mildly with Miss
Miranda at his side, a very changed and happy Miss
Miranda who seemed to love watching one stone
replaced above another as though each were a miracle.
When Elizabeth and David should come back
for the first vacation of their college year, the house
would be under roof at least, so that warm red tiles
and sharp gable-lines would be reflected in the pool
on the lawn. There would be scarlet leaves floating
in the water then, and dry, brown grass nodding
at the edge and, on quiet evenings, there would rock
upon the ripples the shining stars of Orion or the
laughing Pleiades.</p>

<p class='c007'>That time, however, was still distant, for Betsey
and David were entering, this morning, on their
first day of college. They had journeyed from
Harwood and came up from the station together,
but now stood near the great gray arch that led
to the main campus, at the place where they must
part. The Scientific School, where David was to
enter, stood just across the road, showing a brick-columned
entrance-way with heavy iron gates and
a hurrying throng passing out and in. The two
had been discussing the future year most earnestly
when they set out, but the talk had languished and
they had fallen quite silent now. Hundreds of people,
it seemed, were hastening past them, all young,
all eager, all absorbed in their varied errands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I dread a little,” Betsey confessed at last; “it
is so new and strange and different. I wanted so
much to come here, but now, just at the last minute,
I would be glad to go home again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>David nodded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I feel the same way,” he agreed. “But I think
anything big enough to be worth while is bound to
be dreaded a little too. The feeling won’t last long.
Well, the bell is ringing, we must go on, I think.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They said good-by and turned to go in their opposite
directions. Beyond the vine-covered arch a
great bell was swinging in one of those same towers
that they had watched across the valley, a silvery,
sweet-voiced bell, for all the greatness of its sound.
Betsey walked forward, surrounded more and more
by hurrying companions, a few of them girls from
her school whom she knew, many, many of them
strangers, but all looking as though they might some
day be friends. It was a close-pressing throng as she
came to the entrance of the main building where she
must go in, so that she had to mount slowly, step by
step, to the door. She could look back, down the
straight walk, under the arch, through the great gate
opposite to where, far beyond, a similar group was
pressing into a similar doorway. For a fleeting second
she felt a little lonely, a little homesick, before
such sensations were carried away in the rush of excited
thought of all that was in store for her. She
was glad that she could still see David’s red head
from afar and that it was the last thing of which
she caught a glimpse, just as the hastening crowd
swept her across the threshold and into a new world.</p>
